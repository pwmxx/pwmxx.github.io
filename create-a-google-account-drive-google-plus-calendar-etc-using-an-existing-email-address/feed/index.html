					<description><![CDATA[If I accept a shared calendar request and access it using this method, can I get that calendar to show up on my iphone calendar app?  
When I go through the settings the way that I would expect to be successful, it brings me back to the add account screen before we finish setup of the new account.
(I&#039;m setting this up on someone else&#039;s phone... I have an actual gmail address.  I&#039;m hoping that they don&#039;t need to set up a gmail address to make this work)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You have no idea how much I have tried to create a business youtube account, I can&#039;t do it! I don&#039;t know what I am doing wrong, but mine doesn&#039;t looked the way other business accounts do (Videos, playlist, more info tabs etc) it looks like a regular channel. I already had a gmail account so I linked my G+ business account to youtube.
Can you help me, please?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not familiar with Centurylink I&#039;m afraid, but you can set up Google Mail to access other email addresses via POP or IMAP, and I&#039;d be very surprised if any email system didn&#039;t allow for that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use Outlook and have an email account with Centurylink that most friends and clients use and am sure have saved.  I have had numerous problems with Outlook and am sick and tired of the problems and wasted hours trying to get problems resolved with my ISP and MS.

Can I use Gmail in such a way that when I send emails from my Gmail acct my Centurylink email address appears in my emails rather than my Gmail email address?]]></description>
