					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterwm.com/web-hosting-comparison/#comment-22047&quot;&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Victor!

I do include VPS.NET who offer Uk based data centres, but you&#039;re right, the only UK owned and operated one there is my own. Sadly I just don&#039;t have enough data on other UK based firms to offer meaningful recommendations.

That being said, I could actually get some (I&#039;ve a good relationship with lots of people in the hosting sector, including folks at UK2, etc.) so might update this post soon.

My own host, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtique.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Webtique,&lt;/a&gt; offers shared hosting as standard, but with very few accounts on each server. I can also offer custom servers etc on request.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Peter, what about some British hosting companies? I use Krystal Hosting. Just been with their Ruby (their highest costing shared) hosting a few months but they seem to be shaping up well. My other British host is Studyhost but they only have one grade of shared hosting. Is your boutique hosting a standard shared - ie would your sever average response speed be comparable with Krystal&#039;s Ruby hosting? 

Thanks for a great site, by the way!]]></description>
