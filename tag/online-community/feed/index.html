<p>My hands are so chilly that I&#8217;m starting to fear for my typing skilsl thgouhg. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I spent the past hour putting some snowflakes on one of my private client&#8217;s WordPress sites, check it out, they look 3D&#8230;and very cool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice little trick that shows people you mean more than just business. It&#8217;s not exactly new, but it&#8217;s the first time they&#8217;ve done it so their online community is in for a treat.</p>
<p>I am going to suggest we replace it with a nice warm fire as we get closer to Yuletide though! And maybe a virtual glass of whiskey to warm our bellies too.</p>

You want your tribe to be well-positioned, and desirable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just just new members either, butÂ existingÂ ones want to know they&#8217;re a part of something exciting, something that ranks highly.Â SomethingÂ prestigious.</p>
<p>The &#8220;meta tags&#8221; in your site&#8217;s code are really important here. There&#8217;s a science behind it of course, but it&#8217;s something you want an expert like myself to help you with. They&#8217;re small pieces of code that search engines read to get a better ides of what your site is about, and what keywords it should look for.</p>
<p>However, here&#8217;s one of the tricks of the trade you can use yourself. This tool gives you feedback and advice regarding your meta data, helpfully colour coded for people who don&#8217;t want to worry about interpreting too much of it.</p>
<p>My favourite metric it returns is to check how relevant your keywords are to your content. This is an absolute must, and something to look at for all your pages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit technical, but the colour coding helps.</p>
<p>Mind you, so can I.</p>

<blockquote><p>An online community is a virtual community that exists online and whose members enable its existence through taking part in membership ritual.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love the idea of describing our online interactions as ritual. After all, ritual permeates all of what we do. I even brush my teeth in a certain way that has become ritualistic. (Start on the lower left, scrubbing around the bottom before moving to the top).</p>
<p>Ritual can, at it&#8217;s most basic, be defined as:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ritual" target="_blank"><strong>5. </strong><strong>a. </strong> A detailed method of procedure faithfully or regularly followed</a></p>
<p>That for me is it&#8217;s most basic meaning. I love ritual as an experience, something that can be shared, and transformative.</p>
<p>And that is the highest ideal of any online community, to help individuals change through participation in a shared group experience. The online medium of course is very different to a religious or secular ceremony, but it&#8217;s differences afford people the option to engage in a different way, to play out other parts of themselves, which is turn allows for a completely different transformation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my thought of the day. It&#8217;s amazing the train of thoughts a simple Wikipedia search can inspire.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve brushed my teeth, now on to work.</p>
<p>via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community">Online community &#8211; Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>.</p>
