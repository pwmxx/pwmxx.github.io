								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My WordPress site is so fast, I’m not even sure I can call it WordPress anymore.</h2>
<p><strong>Static site generators are awesome.</strong></p>
<p>They create blindingly fast sites, with very few drawbacks (more on those later).</p>
<p>But I’ve been using WordPress since it was a small blogging platform call b2. I’m used to it, I like it, and already have a swag of sites built on it for myself; not just my clients.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">I work in SEO</a> speed is really crucial to what I do. I do a lot of caching and optimisation work for people, but wanted to see what would happen if I really pushed the envelope out.</p>
<p>Initially I was keen to make a front-end that pulled data out of a basic WordPress install using JSON. I set up a proof-of-concept successfully, but wasn’t so keen on remaking all my layouts and front-end design from scratch for it. Besides, basic things like the WordPress menu editor, text widgets etc. are something I very much enjoy using.</p>
<p>I did some research, and came across a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP2Static.</a> It’s a slick plugin that basically does just what I wanted – it packages up WordPress sites as static sites you can deploy anywhere. With a bit of configuring you can actually use it to output to a folder on the same server, and use some basic .htaccess rules so that becomes the public facing side of things.</p>
<p>Which is cool, but I wanted to go for MAXIMUM SPEED. My end goal was to get the site hosted on GitHub Pages, and then use Cloudflare to CDN it around the world.</p>
<p>(WP2Static does actually have a system to deploy to GitHub Pages built-in, but I found the deployment process just too slow.)</p>
<p>So when I considered everything I was trying to achieve, which included keeping the live site on the same URL it was already on, I opted to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>move the WordPress install of my site off its current server, onto my localhost machine (it’s fast and I back it up regularly)</li>
<li>use WP2Static to output the site to a local folder</li>
<li>use git via the terminal to publish the site</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, for a nerd, it seems fairly straightforward. And on the whole it worked much more easily than I anticipated. The main glitches to overcome were that a number of font files weren’t being picked up by the plugin for inclusion in the static site. But it has a configuration option to force it to include certain file paths, so that was easily overcome.</p>
<p>I did need to create a manual 404.html page (GitHub Pages looks for that in the top directory of a site) but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>There were a few other tiny things that were really specific to my own WordPress setup – like realising my sitemap.xml file needed to be a flat XML file rather than an index linking to other XML files – because they weren’t going to be wrapped up by the plugin.</p>
<p>The thing you really lose with any static site system though is (logically) user interaction. In my case that was just forms, but I was happy to replace my contact form with a simple email address – anything else I might need in the future I can do by embedding forms directly from another system like Google Forms.</p>
<p>I used to sell a couple of SEO packages directly through my site, but Woocommerce was always overkill for that anyway. In the future I’ll just use a combination of Paypal buttons to replicate the same functionality – and in fact it’ll be simpler for the end user because I don’t need to know all their billing address information to start an SEO job with them.</p>
<p>The really big day-to-day drawback is that clicking ‘Publish’ in WordPress doesn’t publish anything anymore. The process to run a new export with WP2Static and then send it to GitHub Pages takes about two minutes. But considering how often I blog or change anything on the site that’s not a major issue. Like with anything, you need to weigh up the processes, pros and cons against how you actually use something to determine if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>The site I did all this too, fyi, is the one you’re on right now. This is a static site, hosted for free on GitHub Pages and replicated on servers around the world using Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Google PageSpeed Insights gives a 99% speed rating for Desktop. And the missing 1% is simply because I include an external file that I can’t set an expiration header for – ironically that file is the script for Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Pingdom (my preferred speed testing system, because you can choose a server location for the real-world load-time to be tested against – so if your clients are predominantly in London then choose that server to get an idea of the speed as they’ll see it) gives the homepage a 0.212 second loading time. For something ultimately based on WordPress as a content management system, that’s impressive.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually do resolutions or anything like that, but as this site is now a few years old it makes sense to resolve to make myself a new one.</p>
<p>It might take a bit longer than usual because I&#8217;ll be doing it all with a &#8220;static site generator&#8221;, which is simply a useful way to generate sites that don&#8217;t have really advanced features, like e-commerce. But it allows for blindingly fast sites (in fact they load about 4x faster than a WordPress site!) so is a good direction to head in.</p>
<p>Of course if you want a <a href="/wordpress-website-development/">new website for 2018,</a> or just to make sure your existing one <a href="/one-off-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">gets as many visitors as possible,</a> let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all year.</p>

That statement is a little over-simplified because the process of moving really takes a lot longer than the single day the truck is filled with your stuff.</p>
<p>In some ways we&#8217;re still moving, but telling ourselves we&#8217;ve settled (or at least are settling) into the house we plan for our kids to grow up in.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have bought a house in this economy, in our favourite town (Glastonbury). There <em>was</em> some fairly well-attended shindig in the area around the time we moved, but by and large it stayed out of our way.</p>
<p>The day of the move was itself stressful&mdash;as they tend to be. Everything took longer than planned; we got everything in only to realise we&#8217;d designated the wrong rooms and needed to move it all about, and just where the hell are my clean pants anyway.</p>
<p>And now I find myself settled in my office, with my computer on, speakers operational, second monitor shining it&#8217;s light upon me, and I&#8217;m struck by how reliable the net can be.</p>
<p>Sure, Facebook can&#8217;t make up its mind how it wants to dress itself, email servers can be a bit of an arse sometimes, and Amazon is still convenient, if not a bit ethically questionable.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s all right there. The methods I use to interact with friends and family across the world, the means to put dinner on my families table&mdash;they haven&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p>My surrounds have, but I have this little window through which the world doesn&#8217;t look so different.</p>
<p>And while technology is mercifully always adapting, it can also function as as a dependable &#8220;room with a view&#8221; from any house, train, or airport lounge.</p>
<p>In turn I reflect on my own website. While I was packing boxes, only to unpack them the next day, and helping move heavy bits of furniture that I&#8217;m sure we paid someone else to carry about, my website was viewed by 200 different people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve carved out a piece of digital real estate, that even in my absence, when my mind is firmly elsewhere, still attracts people from all manner of places. It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m happy with it.</p>
