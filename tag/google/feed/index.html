								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>SEO is SEO, but when you&#8217;re advertising the different forms of English can get in the way.</h2>
<p><strong>I work with people all around the world, but there&#8217;s quite a bit more to achieving that than you might think.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to sell services around the world from the comfort of your own office is fantastic. But for those of us with geographically ambiguous spellings it raises a few issues.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2109" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I speak (and write) <em>British English</em> &#8211; or as we like to call it, just <em>English. </em>So naturally I list my services using that spelling; in this case <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">Search Engine Optimisation.</a> But a large proportion of people around the world will be spelling that last word with a Z rather than an S.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s John Mueller has tried to say it doesn&#8217;t make a difference but I rather think he&#8217;s over-simplifying the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My understanding is it doesn&#39;t play any role for SEO &#8212; maybe for users (and conversions), but not directly for SEO.</p>
<p>&mdash; üçå John üçå (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1100684747565686784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We can see in Google Search Console variants based on language are reported as different stats. I simply don&#8217;t believe Google&#8217;s system is allowing different spellings of words interchangeably. Searching for &#8220;Search Engine Optimisation&#8221; is much more likely to find my site than the American spelling precisely because I use it more often in my text.</p>
<p>There are ways I try to work around this. When I sell my services on specific service marketplaces (like <a href="https://pph.me/peter">PeoplePerHour)</a> they have the option to include &#8216;tags&#8217; behind the scenes &#8211; users don&#8217;t see those but they help support the sites&#8217; fairly rudimentary search functions. So that&#8217;s a nice way of making sure I&#8217;m found for both spellings there.</p>
<p>But the second part of John Mueller&#8217;s reply is the most interesting. Let&#8217;s imagine Google did have some magic way of knowing everything all language variations were referring to and would show results regardless of those differences. The meta information displayed isn&#8217;t going to change. I could be found for Optimization but the information in front of the user will <strong>still</strong> say Optimisation.</p>
<p>That slight language difference could put a potential client off.</p>
<p>The better approach would be to allow different meta settings for different languages. But even that is fraught with technical and other issues &#8211; really there is just no simple fix for this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue to sell my SEO services around the world, but predominantly to the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Purely for technical reasons &#8211; because when it comes to <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">delivering awesome SEO</a> I can do that for anyone, anywhere.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>All off-site SEO basically comes down to is creating <em>backlinks.</em></h2>
<p><strong>Directory listings, local citations, they&#8217;re all much the same when it comes to it.</strong></p>
<p>Backlinks help if they&#8217;re legitimate &#8211; which means someone likes your site and has a proper reason to link to it. Any attempt to manipulate your own link profile goes <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against Google&#8217;s guidelines</a> &#8211; and they&#8217;re adept at catching people and penalising them for it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2098" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png" alt="" width="440" height="145" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-240x79.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about this a number of times &#8211; <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/back-links/">you can read some of those</a> if you&#8217;d like more information.</p>
<p>My approach to SEO is entirely Google friendly; I very much believe the best approach is to match the search engines&#8217; approach and fulfill their guidelines and recommendations.</p>
<p>This is sort of a catch-22, because while you shouldn&#8217;t fake links you do want them. My usual advice is to make use of your real life contacts to get some &#8211; ask suppliers or related sites to link to you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I should add too when people DO get links without properly asking people they really know for them &#8211; they tend to get extremely low quality ones. Too many low quality links hurts rather than helps. For example, every single person I&#8217;ve ever seen selling a <em>BBC, Apple</em> or <em>Huffington Post</em> link are actually just creating user profiles on those systems and sticking URLs in the bio section of those profiles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really a proper link on the BBC! People think they&#8217;re going to get something in a news article, but more often than not they&#8217;re on pages Google doesn&#8217;t even index. The effect is people buy a back link on a &#8216;high quality domain&#8217; but don&#8217;t get any SEO authority for it at all.</p>
<p>The people selling these links aren&#8217;t even doing it manually. There are automated tools they use to create hundreds of links in a few minutes. <strong>Google is smarter than this.</strong></p>
<p>Because Google says explicitly that trying to manipulate your own link profile is against their terms there is no such thing as paying for <em>Google safe</em> links. It&#8217;s an oxymoron.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>We&#8217;ve known for a long time that how fast your site loads is important for SEO.</h2>
<p><strong>Google have <em>increased</em> the importance of your website&#8217;s mobile speed when working out where to rank it.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been true for a while that there&#8217;s been some small impact on your ranking based on mobile speed (desktop speed has been important for years) but now that&#8217;s been ramped up.</p>
<p>The most important metrics they use remain the sort of SEO work I do in the code and the quality of your content &#8211; but when those things are being looked after mobile speed is where you should turn your attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the automated tests out there tend to be a bit alarmist <a href="https://peterwm.com/problems-with-google-pagespeed-insights/">(I blogged about that recently)</a> but they can still serve as a reminder that there&#8217;s nearly always room for improvement.</p>
<p>WordPress certainly has its issues with speed. And most themes are still being built for desktop-first (meaning how it looks on a desktop computer is the primary concern, and then it&#8217;s cut down and limited for mobile) when in fact current standards are clear that mobile-first should be the designers focus.</p>
<p>Be aware that although the testing systems are imperfect, and WordPress is very hard to score upwards of 80% with on most systems &#8211; the faster your site is the better.</p>
<p>In fact, mobile speed is now more important than desktop speed as a ranking metric for Google.</p>
<p>As a general piece of advice, my favourite tool for testing a site&#8217;s overall speed (not mobile specific) is <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pingdom.</a></p>
<p>They give you a list of different servers to choose from; so it&#8217;s easier to get a real-world figure for your loading time in seconds &#8211; just like your target market will see it. Choose the nearest server to your primary audience, et voila.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2067" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pingdom-test-440x304.png" alt="" width="440" height="304" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pingdom-test-440x304.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pingdom-test-240x166.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pingdom-test-768x530.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pingdom-test.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></h2>
<p>(Although none of the online speed testing tools are perfect, Pingdom has a lot of useful features.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>There are times your SEO results will look like the opposite of what you&#8217;re after.</h2>
<p><strong>Average Position is a bit of a weird metric. Here&#8217;s why.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2052" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-440x188.png" alt="" width="440" height="188" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-440x188.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-240x102.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-768x327.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained.png 931w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Consider that graph for a moment. Taken directly from Google Search Console (Google&#8217;s official stats package for organic search &#8211; and my recommendation for the tool you should use to get your ranking and other organic search results) they show two highlighted metrics;</p>
<ul>
<li>Total impressions (in teal) and</li>
<li>Average position (in purple).</li>
</ul>
<p>Impressions is the number of times a site was seen in search results. Average position is the average rank it was seen in.</p>
<p>(Google averages your rank across all impressions as a useful workaround to their personalisation they do when people are searching. Location, how often a user has searched for something before &#8211; there are myriad ways Google skews results. Averaging them out is the best approach to find the most useful ranking to report.)</p>
<p>If you look at the lines on the graph though you&#8217;ll see a number of places where the position appears to get <em>worse </em>right when the impressions become more successful. You&#8217;d think stats should improve hand-in-hand, not get worse as one improves. Right?</p>
<p>In reality, when impressions spikes it&#8217;s <em>normal</em> for the average position to drop. If a site suddenly has a lot more visibility, it usually means it&#8217;s being found for a bunch of terms and searches it wasn&#8217;t previously. A lot of those new terms are likely to be things sort of around the periphery of what the site is about, not just it&#8217;s core purpose. So it&#8217;s being found for a bunch of extra search terms.</p>
<p>The result of that is those new terms probably aren&#8217;t ranking terribly highly. They&#8217;re not the site&#8217;s main purpose, so won&#8217;t be ranking as highly as the normal terms the site has been successful for.</p>
<p><em>Which drags the average rank DOWN.</em></p>
<p>Not only is this good to know when interpreting your own results, but it serves as a reminder that stats aren&#8217;t simply the end of the story, it&#8217;s important to understand how they come about, and what their effect on each other is.</p>

<h2>Searching for yourself is a terrible idea</h2>
<p><strong>I still get asked a lot about discrepancies between what a client sees when they search for themselves, and either the official stats, or what their friend might see, etc.</strong></p>
<p>So this is a refresher about why you shouldn&#8217;t search for yourself as a way to measure your ranking.</p>
<p>Google does all kinds of personalisation on your search results (based on your network&#8217;s IP address, if you&#8217;re logged into any Google accounts, even your location) and the more often you look for your own site, the more skewed those results will be.</p>
<p>To give an example, most people searching for &#8220;peter mahoney&#8221; see my site on the first page. But I see myself on the fourth. Essentially because I&#8217;ve searched for myself so often &#8211; and then not spent much time on my site or even bothered to click it &#8211; Google has &#8220;learnt&#8221; that I don&#8217;t like it and therefore ranks it down for me, uniquely.</p>
<p>The right place to get Google&#8217;s official rank for your site is their own monitoring systems, which is where I get my stats.</p>
<p>Their stats are actually an &#8216;average&#8217; of your rank which is the statistically most useful approach. Because of personalisation, not everyone sees your site in the same position. Where someone is searching from geographically for example has an impact. So the average rank is the best indicator of where you rank.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a commonly held belief that if you use a private browsing window somehow you&#8217;ll see the proper rankings in the search results. But all that does is prevent Google from knowing your account &#8211; they still know where you live, your IP address, in some cases the unique code for your network card &#8211; there&#8217;s *plenty* for them to skew your results with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

<p>Over the past week I&#8217;ve seen more than my fair share of emails from Google regarding &#8220;<span class="il">Nonsecure</span> Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56&#8243;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big change, but not exactly a surprising one.</p>
<p>Google has been pushing to make the web more secure for a long time. Seeing HTTPS and green padlocks all over the web has been a key direction for them &#8211; they&#8217;ve even given secure sites a ranking boost as part of their algorithms. This new change is really an extension of their general SEO ethos.</p>
<p>So anyone running the latest version of Google&#8217;s Chrome Browser (version 56) will see a warning when browsing any web page that asks for sensitive information. The examples they&#8217;ve given are passwords or credit card details but undoubtedly there&#8217;s other situations a user would be presented with a warning too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been recommending web owners migrate to HTTPS for a few years, but now it&#8217;s become really important especially if you have any¬†page users¬†can log in through (including I expect WordPress Dashboard login pages like wp-login.php) or e-commerce.</p>
<p>These things may well be frustrating when they first crop up, requiring immediate changes to your website. But bear in mind Google has been open about their general desires for the web (that it be easy to find useful information, that it be secure, mobile friendly and fast) for a long time. So as long as you apply those same concepts to your own site as soon as you can then changes like this will actually put you ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>In case you know this impacts you but haven&#8217;t yet had the email from Google about it (or don&#8217;t use Google Search Console in which case you&#8217;d never get one) here is the text of their message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonsecure Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56 for http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>To: owner of http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>Beginning in January 2017, Chrome (version 56 and later) will mark pages that collect passwords or credit card details as ‚ÄúNot Secure‚Äù unless the pages are served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>The following URLs include input fields for passwords or credit card details that will trigger the new Chrome warning. Review these examples to see where these warnings will appear, and so you can take action to help protect users‚Äô data. The list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>{examples are given here}</p>
<p>The new warning is the first stage of a long-term plan to mark all pages served over the non-encrypted HTTP protocol as ‚ÄúNot Secure‚Äù.</p></blockquote>

<p>Google Apps (used for business email, file sharing, calendaring etc.) is now rebranded as G Suite.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a bad mid-90s R&amp;B group. (Try as I might, I can&#8217;t forget¬†&#8220;Rappin&#8217; 4-Tay&#8221;.)*</p>
<p>In their official blog post, Google said this is more in keeping more with their mission to provide a series of tools businesses use to further their own purposes. Basically rather than a series of individual applications coming together they see it as a stock set of tools within one Google system.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Google Apps proved to be an invaluable tools for companies, schools and universities, and I do hope G Suite continues to build on and improve those systems.</p>
<p>But I do have one niggling concern in the back of my mind. Google Apps used to be free for small firms, then overnight all new accounts were subject to a subscription fee. Existing free accounts continued to run with charge &#8211; but any change to Apps brings a fear they might start to charge for those grandfathered accounts.</p>
<p>And with a change this big, well &#8211; Google Apps keep free accounts, but will G Suite?</p>

</a>*Although I thought of making this joke myself, I wasn&#8217;t the first, <a href="https://s3z.me/s/908" target="_blank">so credit goes here</a></p>

<p>Well they&#8217;ve really increased this as a search signal ‚Äì sites that are NOT mobile friendly will now have a very hard time competing with those that are.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also updated <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">their mobile friendliness test</a> to make it more restrictive‚Äîit&#8217;s worth retesting your sites to make sure they still pass. Of course the best test is always the information displayed within Google Search Console which reports on the entire site, not just one page at a time.</p>
<p>The extra good news for those of you with mobile responsive sites is that any of your competitors who do not have mobile friendly sites will now suffer in their¬†rankings.</p>
<p>One related point, there is a growing body of data that suggests this change also affects (in a smaller capacity) sites from normal desktops ‚Äì that Google is prioritising sites that are mobile friendly on searches from ALL devices.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t confirmed that yet, so it&#8217;s not certain, but I am keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a responsive site for mobile devices yet and you don&#8217;t want to get caught out, <a href="https://peterwm.com/contact/">please contact me</a> and I can help make you a new, fully mobile complaint one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m often asked about how to change the description Google shows in their search results.¬†(This post applies in part to many search engines, but Google in particular.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1698" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/google-search-results-descriptions-440x99.png" alt="google-search-results-descriptions" width="440" height="99" />The answer is slightly more complicated than any of us might like. The old response (going back a decade or more) was to just change your meta description tag. Those used to be picked up verbatim.</p>
<p>But these days Google isn&#8217;t beholden to anything we provide (with the exception perhaps of your own domain name). They can pick and choose what they think will be most useful to their users. They don&#8217;t have to use the description we provide&#8211;they can choose to ignore it and create their own.</p>
<div>If we want to give our descriptions the best possible chance of being picked up, they need to conform to the following:</div>
<ul>
<li>be between 150-159 characters*</li>
<li>be in sentence structure</li>
<li>not include too many commas or ands &#8211; basically avoid things that make it look like it could be a list of keywords</li>
<li>ideally, it would be a whole sentence or two taken directly from the text of the page</li>
<li>in fact, really ideally it would be the first sentence or two from the page</li>
</ul>
<p>and on top of all that of course it needs to fit our own needs of being informative and enticing people to visit the site.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>* = Normally 130-160 (or some other variant within that range, but usually ending with 160) is touted as acceptable. Recent data suggests in fact 160 may be too long, many pages with 160 characters exactly are finding their descriptions are being truncated before the last word with a ellipses (&#8230;) added, making it look unfinished. So 159 seems the current practical maximum.</p>
