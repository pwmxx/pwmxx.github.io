Blogging is <strong>the very best</strong> thing you can do for your search engine optimisation. If you are not blogging, you are ignoring the biggest factor in improving your placement in their listings.</p>
<p>Quite simply, if you put all the other tips and tricks aside, the real key to SEO is regular, original content.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really simple. Google et al want to see content written by humans, for humans. So write some.</p>
<p>1. Regular<br />
Search engines work out how often to scan your website and specific pages within that based on how often it has seen those change in the past.</p>
<p>If your pages are all fairly static (meaning there aren&#8217;t any elements on them that change regularly, like text or images) the search giants (Google, Bing, Yahoo!) will stop coming. Google might only index your site every few months.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some massive missed opportunities there. Not only will your site be deemed to have a low Page Rank (not very important in the search results) but even if you do update with some new amazing, original content—it might not be noticed until it&#8217;s well out of date.</p>
<p>2. Original<br />
Search Engines are clever. Google is adept at scanning text and knowing if it&#8217;s the sort of thing a human would read, rather than a bunch of words strung together to try to fool it. They also know very easily if your work is a copy and paste from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Apart from simply making money, search engines all have an ethos behind them. Google for example wants to see a helpful, information rich Internet that answers users&#8217; queries quickly and efficiently. So they rank sites they believe fit into that plan more highly than those that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If your site has too much content pasted from elsewhere, you do not fit into this ideal.</p>
<p>What does is original content. Something <em>you&#8217;ve</em> written (or someone else has written exclusively on your behalf).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as hard as it sounds. Pick a subject that relates to your business. I do this with my blog all the time—and then in your head explain it as you would to one of your customers. Type out your side of the conversation, and you&#8217;re basically done.</p>
<p>3. Keywords<br />
Before you even ask the question, the answer is yes. You do want to target keywords in your blogging. Bear in mind that as long as you&#8217;re writing on topic, they&#8217;ll come out anyway. You want people to find you because of the sort of products and services you offer, so as long as you&#8217;re writing about the subject you sell, they&#8217;ll flow naturally.</p>
<p>Rather than ensuring I type specific words, I do my best to hit a variety of terms.</p>
<p>The sentence you just read is a case in point—it would have seemed normal to use &#8220;words&#8221; in there twice; where I did and then again at the end of the sentence. By using &#8220;terms&#8221; the second time, I&#8217;m improving my SEO because I&#8217;ll be indexed for both &#8220;words&#8221; and &#8220;terms&#8221;, rather than just one of them.</p>
<p>I do this all the time. Synonyms are are important but often overlooked aspect of SEO. A potential client might enter either &#8220;social media&#8221; or &#8220;social networking&#8221; for instance, and if that&#8217;s your industry you want them to find you regardless of the phrase they&#8217;re most familiar with.</p>
<p>Search engine optimisation is all about people—people finding you. Make sure you&#8217;re giving them what they need to do precisely that.</p>
