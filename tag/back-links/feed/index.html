								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>All off-site SEO basically comes down to is creating <em>backlinks.</em></h2>
<p><strong>Directory listings, local citations, they&#8217;re all much the same when it comes to it.</strong></p>
<p>Backlinks help if they&#8217;re legitimate &#8211; which means someone likes your site and has a proper reason to link to it. Any attempt to manipulate your own link profile goes <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against Google&#8217;s guidelines</a> &#8211; and they&#8217;re adept at catching people and penalising them for it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2098" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png" alt="" width="440" height="145" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-240x79.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about this a number of times &#8211; <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/back-links/">you can read some of those</a> if you&#8217;d like more information.</p>
<p>My approach to SEO is entirely Google friendly; I very much believe the best approach is to match the search engines&#8217; approach and fulfill their guidelines and recommendations.</p>
<p>This is sort of a catch-22, because while you shouldn&#8217;t fake links you do want them. My usual advice is to make use of your real life contacts to get some &#8211; ask suppliers or related sites to link to you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I should add too when people DO get links without properly asking people they really know for them &#8211; they tend to get extremely low quality ones. Too many low quality links hurts rather than helps. For example, every single person I&#8217;ve ever seen selling a <em>BBC, Apple</em> or <em>Huffington Post</em> link are actually just creating user profiles on those systems and sticking URLs in the bio section of those profiles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really a proper link on the BBC! People think they&#8217;re going to get something in a news article, but more often than not they&#8217;re on pages Google doesn&#8217;t even index. The effect is people buy a back link on a &#8216;high quality domain&#8217; but don&#8217;t get any SEO authority for it at all.</p>
<p>The people selling these links aren&#8217;t even doing it manually. There are automated tools they use to create hundreds of links in a few minutes. <strong>Google is smarter than this.</strong></p>
<p>Because Google says explicitly that trying to manipulate your own link profile is against their terms there is no such thing as paying for <em>Google safe</em> links. It&#8217;s an oxymoron.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote a post about backlinks. But it&#8217;s always worth re-iterating this.</p>
<p>In short, my stance on these has only become stronger, because Google has become even more clever.</p>
<p>The shortest answer to the backlink question is that having backlinks is very beneficial.</p>
<p>But the longer answer is actually more important. Google has become incredibly adept at working out which backlinks are natural (i.e., someone liked your site and linked to it) as opposed to bought, meaning you paid for them.</p>
<p>Natural backlinks help your SEO, generally speaking. As for manipulated ones, once Google realises what you&#8217;ve done (which can take a few months) they will usually hurt your rank, often quite drastically.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people selling what they called &#8220;safe&#8221; links, or &#8220;Google friendly links&#8221;. In truth Google is very clear that any attempt to buy or create links is contrary to their ethos and something they will try to find and penalise you for.</p>
<p>And they are very good at it.</p>
<p>The reason people still sell them is a quirk of Google&#8217;s algorithm. When Google first see new links come in for a site they will <em>almost</em> always improve that sites ranking. It&#8217;s not until they&#8217;ve seen the patterns emerge and they realise they were faked links that they penalise you.</p>
<p>So when someone first buys links they usually do see an improvement, and feel happy with the service that made them. Months later when their site takes a hit&mdash;it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>So, are backlinks good? Absolutely. Should you try to have them created on your behalf? Absolutely not.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1533" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/seo-backlinks-lies-440x150.jpg" alt="seo-backlinks-lies" width="440" height="150" />Here&#8217;s a pretty typical advert you&#8217;ll see online when searching for SEO, &#8220;I can create 33 SEO backlink Panda Penguin safe from PR10&#8221;.</p>
<p>The trouble is it&#8217;s all <strong>LIES.</strong></p>
<p>I know I bang on about the trouble with buying backlinks to try to help your SEO. Regular readers will be familiar with my disdain for people selling the impossible—since Google&#8217;s Panda algorithm tries very hard to find people buying links, saying any scheme like this is &#8220;Panda safe&#8221; or even worse, &#8220;Panda friendly&#8221; is a massive fib.</p>
<p>So at the risk of repeating myself, I&#8217;m going to say some things I&#8217;ve said before &#8211; albeit in a more concise and succinct form.</p>
<p>It is true that Google does like to see links to your site. But they are excellent at discerning real links (where someone liked your site or service enough to link to it) from purchased ones. Those bought ones are usually just low quality directories and profiles. When I say profiles I really mean it, user accounts get created on the Apple website that have your domain in the user description and the scam-sellers have the nerve to say that&#8217;s a PR10 link from a high quality domain. As if Google can&#8217;t tell the difference between say, a news story on the BBC and a bunch of comment-user accounts.</p>
<p>I generally stand against buying backlinks because of my <em>SEO ethos.</em> My ethos is simple by the way &#8211; Google have given us a swag of information regarding what search engines do and do not want &#8211; so I say we give them what they&#8217;re after. But on the flipside we need to be sure to avoid what they <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want.</p>
<p>I have about three jobs a week come in from people who bought back links and got caught &#8211; and dropped off Google completely. When they penalise you, they <strong>really</strong> hit you hard.</p>
<p>Technically speaking really awesome backlinks would certainly help your SEO. But 99% of the time buying them is not awesome, and I recommend avoiding it.</p>
<p>I (like Google) see SEO as a long game, if done properly. But also, if done properly, it &#8220;sticks&#8221;. A site with good SEO that&#8217;s risen to the top should stay at the top.</p>
<p>And with that, I shall get down from my well-trodden soap-box.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-650" title="SEO" alt="Search Engine Optimisation, SEO, blog post series" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/seo-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;m starting a series on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) to help explain a few key concepts, as well as helping guide you towards the right SEO expert. Ideally me of course, but whoever is telling you they&#8217;re an expert really should know how to cover more than the basics.</p>
<p>The number of people I see selling SEO services who really have no idea is appalling. (I&#8217;d say shocking, but there are a lot of opportunists out there!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to break my series of SEO posts into the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Site Speed</li>
<li>Social integration</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Back-links and all other things link oriented</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally there is a lot of cross-over between them, but over the course of the series you&#8217;ll get a better idea of some key concepts, and some fairly original (but proven) ideas for their implementation.</p>
<p>All of course to get you more quality visitors!</p>
