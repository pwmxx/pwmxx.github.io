<h2>A leaking glass more than half-full</h2>
<p>Links pointing in to your site are really important for SEO. Google has started suggesting they may be less and less important, and give it 5-7 years I think they&#8217;ll be one of the lesser important SEO criteria (in favour of RankBrain and Artificial Intelligence tools that can really determine how quality the site and it&#8217;s contents are.). But for now, external links from other sites are still important.</p>
<p>But, well, let&#8217;s think of links in and out like a glass of water being filled up and poured out.</p>
<ul>
<li>For each link pointing to your site, lets fill up the glass a little. As it gets fuller it gets more SEO authority, which is great.</li>
<li>But for each link out, we can empty the glass a bit too.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if for every link you have <em>in</em> you also have one <em>out,</em> the glass actually ends up empty*.</p>
<p>People used to make sites called &#8220;link traps&#8221; that didn&#8217;t link externally to anything, trying to full their glass right up. But as you&#8217;d expect Google got wise to this technique, and started to penalise sites if they did this—it&#8217;s contrary to the idea of a well-formed world wide web, and Google wants to help steer the web to be as useful as possible.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s important to have some links out. I usually recommend a ratio of 4/1 &#8211; for every four links in, have one link out. That does vary based on a couple of factors, but it&#8217;s a good rule of thumb.</p>
<p>The glass fills faster than it empties, so Google is happy, and we are too.</p>
<p>* &#8211; important note, this is a very simplistic metaphor. Not all links are created equal, so if you have a link to your site from the BBC homepage, and a link out to your friend&#8217;s Etsy shop, you&#8217;d still end up with more water in the glass because in that case the link in has more SEO authority than the page you&#8217;re linking to. But because most sites aren&#8217;t in that position (most sites will have links in and out from sites swimming with them in a similar depth in the pool of link-juice; but I&#8217;ve used enough liquid-based similes for one day), it&#8217;s still a useful analogy.</p>
