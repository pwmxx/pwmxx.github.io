								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not very good at tooting my own horn, but for the record, there are over 1,000 reviews of my service floating around on the internet, an 998 of those are 5-star feedbacks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing website development since 1995, and SEO since 1998. Even according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwell-explains-the-10000-hour-rule-2014-6?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s 10,000 hour</a> rule, that makes me an expert in both areas a few times over.</p>
<p>I just had a moment this morning that reminded myself just how experienced I am what I do. One client signed up for my <a href="https://peterwm.com/monthly-wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">monthly SEO service</a> a few weeks ago. Normally it&#8217;s a month before I issue the first update but I do like to keep an eye on how things are going and check the data fairly regularly.</p>
<p>So when he wrote to ask how things were progressing I was very happy to be able to send him this graph, showing the number of times his site was seen in Google search results over the past 90 days, with a crudely drawn arrow indicating when he started working with me.</p>

<p>So how good am I? Very good. I&#8217;m just not always very good at telling you about it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-386" title="bt-4.7.5.1.83.8.94.1.11-issue" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bt-4.7.5.1.83.8.94.1.11-issue-150x150.png" alt="bt-4.7.5.1.83.8.94.1.11 firmware issue" width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;ve been having major issues with wifi the past few days, and it turns out they&#8217;re all caused by an update to my router by BT. Now, this post is going to seem pretty nerdy, but this issue may affect more of you than you think!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the past three hours looking into this. You see, I&#8217;ve got a pretty complicated home network, fortunately I&#8217;m skilled in such things so it&#8217;s never been a problem. But it does mean when my wifi became unstable I had a lot of variables to consider and check.</p>
<p>A few days ago I noticed my internet connections started to drop-out every 40 seconds or so. Whether it was a local connection (one computer at home talking to another) or going out through the internet (searching Google, checking Facebook, downloading files, etc.).</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realise it was a wifi problem until I did some testing, after all every one of my devices connect wirelessly, so it seemed to be a problem affecting everything.</p>
<p>I ran some tests (pinging various machines and remote servers) and it confirmed what I&#8217;d noticed. After updating and checking everything I could that I&#8217;d set up myself (and extra repeater router, my server, desktop and laptop software) in desperation I checked to see if I could upgrade my BT HomeHub3&#8217;s firmware.</p>
<p>Oh. BT updated it automatically a few days ago. Precisely when the trouble began. A quick search shows a number of their customers complaining that their wifi has stopped working since the update, FYI it&#8217;s called 4.7.5.1.83.8.94.1.11 (Type A).</p>
<p>The update &#8220;fixes&#8221; something called Smart Wifi. The solution is to turn it off.</p>
<p>There is no setting for Smart Wifi on a HomeHub3. In fact it&#8217;s a background process, to turn it off you need to manually select a channel for your wifi to use, instead of the default &#8220;Automatic&#8221; setting.</p>
<p>Now, I already was using a manual channel: channel 6. Nonetheless I I thought perhaps I need to change a few things to fix the Smart Wifi issue, so I turned it back to automatic, then once again to channel 6. Still the issue.</p>
<p>A post on BT&#8217;s customer forums alluded that perhaps BT uses channel 6 as a default, so it might not turn off Smart Wifi if I stay on that channel. I can&#8217;t confirm if that&#8217;s true, but I do know when I changed to a different channel (in my case, 11) SUCCESS!</p>
<p>All my tests show an excellent, stable connection once more.</p>
<p>I should trust myself and my skills more&#8211;and assumed BT were likely responsible from the outset. They usually are.</p>
