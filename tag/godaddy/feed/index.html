								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a huge number of webhosts to choose from. Prices vary widely, which isn&#8217;t too surprising because quality does too.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just assume the cheaper web service is right for you. Here&#8217;s a guide to some of the players:</p>
<p><strong>Hostgator</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=webcraftco" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1104"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Services-Reseller-Hosting-VPS-Hosting-and-Dedicated-Servers-by-HostGator-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Services-Reseller-Hosting-VPS-Hosting-and-Dedicated-Servers-by-HostGator-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg 150w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Services-Reseller-Hosting-VPS-Hosting-and-Dedicated-Servers-by-HostGator-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>From the long list of cheap options to host your website, they&#8217;re certainly my recommendation. Their user interface is easy to get your head around, and their after sales care is pretty good.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much more to say about Hostgator really; it&#8217;s very competitively priced, and does what it says on the tin.</p>
<p><a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=webcraftco" target="_blank">Hostgator</a></p>
<p><strong>GoDaddy</strong></p>
<p><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1105"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Domain-Names-UK-Domain-Name-Registration-Services-GoDaddy-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Domain-Names-UK-Domain-Name-Registration-Services-GoDaddy-150x150.jpg 150w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Domain-Names-UK-Domain-Name-Registration-Services-GoDaddy.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Basically, just don&#8217;t. Never ever.</p>
<p>GoDaddy aren&#8217;t so much in the hosting business, as they are in the spamming business. Having an account with them isn&#8217;t too different from paying someone to send you constant emails that you don&#8217;t want.</p>
<p>If you want more information see my case study on how to tell at a glance that <a title="How to spot good after-sale customer care" href="https://pwmxx.github.io/how-to-spot-good-after-sale-customer-care/" target="_blank">Godaddy doesn&#8217;t prioritise existing customers.</a></p>
<p><strong>Bluehost</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/webcraftdotco" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1102"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Domain-Names-eCommerce-Bluehost.com-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Domain-Names-eCommerce-Bluehost.com-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg 150w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Domain-Names-eCommerce-Bluehost.com-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Bluehost are an OK, <em>very</em> cheap option.</p>
<p>They have some unusual clauses in their contract that gives them the right to cancel any account they deem inappropriate. And being owned by a strict Mormon family, they&#8217;ve been known to block sex-education websites used by schools simply for having the word &#8220;sex&#8221; in them. That seems to be a fairly isolated incident, but funny enough to mention.</p>
<p>Their after sales support isn&#8217;t great, and they tend to put a lot of users on each server which can impact the performance of your site. Basically they&#8217;re an exercise in &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221;. And as I say, they&#8217;re very cheap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/webcraftdotco" target="_blank">Bluehost</a></p>
<p><strong>Pete&#8217;s Boutique</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pwmxx.github.io/services/web-hosting/" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1082"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/william-morris-wallpaper-boutique-webhost-peter-mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Say what? It&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve created my own boutique hosting service. It&#8217;s based on my ethos that I want to make sure my clients get the best online presence they can.</p>
<p>Most web hosts keep costs down by protecting their server processing overheads, and turn off a bunch of features that can really improve the speed and reliability of your site. I turn them all on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small, personal service that treats you as a real person with real dreams for your business, rather than just a line in a database somewhere.</p>
<p><a title="Web hosting" href="https://pwmxx.github.io/services/web-hosting/">Read all about it here.</a></p>
<p><strong>VPS.NET</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://vps.net/" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1103"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cloud-VPS-Server-Hosting-by-VPS.NET-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cloud-VPS-Server-Hosting-by-VPS.NET-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg 150w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cloud-VPS-Server-Hosting-by-VPS.NET-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>I really like their service, although they&#8217;re certainly the most expensive in this comparison. And their system is a little confusing; it&#8217;s geared towards having people sign up for full virtual servers rather than just hosting websites.</p>
<p>There is an option to do the latter, called Cloud Sites, and starts at £13 a month but quickly starts to rack up to £40.</p>
<p>Their support is excellent, which is helpful because the slightly confusing nature of their interface means you&#8217;ll be using it quite a bit at the start.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-555"  title="How to spot good after-sale customer care Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-150x150.png"  alt="How to spot good after-sale customer care Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />This article is alternatively titled: <em>Will you still love me, tomorrow?</em></p>
<p>I had considered something much more risqué to do with trying before you buy, but it seemed a bit crass in the context I intended it.</p>
<p>Whenever you buy something online, you have options. Product choices, price, and most of all, who to buy from. For every product there are several dozen people queuing up to sell it to you.</p>
<p>And the most successful online business are unsurprisingly <em>excellent</em> at selling.</p>
<p>But how can you tell who is going to offer you good after sale care? And the the case of products you buy to interact with online (i.e., online systems that you&#8217;ll log into to manage) how can you spot the people who care about you after you&#8217;ve parted with your cash, from those who just want to keep on selling?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start by putting this out there&#8211;for all sorts of reason, GoDaddy are not a company I recommend. In fact I do my best to warn people off them.</p>
<p>And this is a prime example of why. Below you&#8217;ll see a screenshot of the GoDaddy homepage. I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of highlighting in red, any area of the screen which is wholly, and unquestionably (I went easy on them frankly) devoted to selling.</p>
<p>Now to be fair their is a prominent support line number which is likely useful to both new customers, and exisiting ones.</p>
<p>But the only section <em>devoted</em> to existing customers is that small, plain looking &#8220;Log In to My Account&#8221; button on the top left. Now for sure a lot of business run this way, they are predominantly sales on the first page, and then the bulk of their information (and interactive systems) for clients is behind a password.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d expect to see an obvious login box, with some graphic element drawing out attention to it. Not something so small my daughter&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-Monkeys" target="_blank">Sea Monkeys</a> could probably ride it like a tiny train.</p>
<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s after-sale support is well known to be, frankly, appalling. Unless you&#8217;re buying more products from them in which case they&#8217;d love to help you, yes sir, of course ma&#8217;am, have a nice day!</p>
<p>And you know what? I can see that right there, from their homepage. They haven&#8217;t given screen real estate to existing customers except in the most perfunctory, absolutely necessary way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just an example, albeit a solid one. Before you sign up for an online service (knowing you can very rarely try before you buy), have a look at how much they value their customers, by looking for screen space they&#8217;ve devoted to them.</p>
