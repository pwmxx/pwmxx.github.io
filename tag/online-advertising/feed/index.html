I&#8217;m very specialised at what I do already, but clients do regularly ask me for advice garnered from 18 years experience across a variety of technologies.</p>
<p>So I do have some thoughts to share with you.</p>
<p>One very effective technique with PPC is to target what is known as a &#8220;spread&#8221; of search queries and phrases. That&#8217;s based on making the most of the three different &#8220;tracks&#8221; people take when planning PPC campaigns.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many people make the mistake of just targeting the most popular searches, which of course is a valid technique but places them firmly, <em>exclusively,</em> in a very competitive market. It also costs a lot more to run campaigns of this nature.</li>
<li>Conversely some people will try to do the opposite, target only the less common searches to save themselves money spent on the campaign, but of course they see a lot less traffic.</li>
<li>There is a third-road, which is trying to find searches with a statistically slightly higher popularity, but lower competition. However, the vast nature of Google Adwords and other PPC markets tends to even these &#8220;gaps&#8221; out pretty quickly, so even when they can be found the gap is very narrow.</li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer to approach these campaigns as a spread, to include some targets from all three of these categories. That way you achieve a good mix of results, financial outlay, and it gives you greater scope to track the success of your campaigns and decide which of these might be worth higher future investment.</p>
<p>Basically, you get more options, more data and therefore in the long run a much more strategic and lucrative approach.</p>
