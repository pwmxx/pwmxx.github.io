								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>All off-site SEO basically comes down to is creating <em>backlinks.</em></h2>
<p><strong>Directory listings, local citations, they&#8217;re all much the same when it comes to it.</strong></p>
<p>Backlinks help if they&#8217;re legitimate &#8211; which means someone likes your site and has a proper reason to link to it. Any attempt to manipulate your own link profile goes <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against Google&#8217;s guidelines</a> &#8211; and they&#8217;re adept at catching people and penalising them for it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2098" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png" alt="" width="440" height="145" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-240x79.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about this a number of times &#8211; <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/back-links/">you can read some of those</a> if you&#8217;d like more information.</p>
<p>My approach to SEO is entirely Google friendly; I very much believe the best approach is to match the search engines&#8217; approach and fulfill their guidelines and recommendations.</p>
<p>This is sort of a catch-22, because while you shouldn&#8217;t fake links you do want them. My usual advice is to make use of your real life contacts to get some &#8211; ask suppliers or related sites to link to you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I should add too when people DO get links without properly asking people they really know for them &#8211; they tend to get extremely low quality ones. Too many low quality links hurts rather than helps. For example, every single person I&#8217;ve ever seen selling a <em>BBC, Apple</em> or <em>Huffington Post</em> link are actually just creating user profiles on those systems and sticking URLs in the bio section of those profiles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really a proper link on the BBC! People think they&#8217;re going to get something in a news article, but more often than not they&#8217;re on pages Google doesn&#8217;t even index. The effect is people buy a back link on a &#8216;high quality domain&#8217; but don&#8217;t get any SEO authority for it at all.</p>
<p>The people selling these links aren&#8217;t even doing it manually. There are automated tools they use to create hundreds of links in a few minutes. <strong>Google is smarter than this.</strong></p>
<p>Because Google says explicitly that trying to manipulate your own link profile is against their terms there is no such thing as paying for <em>Google safe</em> links. It&#8217;s an oxymoron.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>No one should be surprised to hear blogging is good for SEO.</h2>
<p><strong>I had an unexpected email interchange with a client a few minutes ago.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d been recommending blogging to him for months. He keeps making excuses why he can&#8217;t; lack of time, what would be write about &#8211; the usual string of things. But I kept pushing because as we all know unique, topical, regular content is great for SEO.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to point out that while I call it <em>blogging</em> really it can be <em>news, updates</em> &#8211; whatever &#8211; just as long as you get well written topical content on your site regularly.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you want from a blog post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unique
<ul>
<li>It needs to be original content to avoid any possibility of a duplicate content issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topical
<ul>
<li>The copy needs to be related to your business. You can&#8217;t just write about your recent holiday if you&#8217;re trying to sell greeting cards. Having said that if you went exploring a variety of greeting card shops while abroad &#8211; that might be enough to make it on topic. (It wouldn&#8217;t be easy to do well though.)</li>
<li>Included in this is it needs to be interesting information, authoritative and useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regular
<ul>
<li>Posting something every week, or even better twice a week, is ideal. Search engines learn to come back and rescan your site for new content often, and it&#8217;s great if there&#8217;s something new for them to index every time. What&#8217;s no good is if you post just a few times a year at fairly random intervals; it&#8217;s better than nothing, but not by much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This client thought he really had me on the issue today when we said he&#8217;d checked with his developer (<em>not</em> another SEO expert, just the person that pieced together his site) and he said not to bother. Because if you search for anything online you&#8217;ll very rarely see a blog post on page one.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s half right. You do rarely see blog posts on page one. But everything else there is wrong.</p>
<p>Just because a blog page might not rank highly on its own merit doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not adding to your overall domain authority. In fact it&#8217;s definitely adding to it. There&#8217;s a reason sites with lots of well written content tend to have homepage&#8217;s that rank more highly than other sites.</p>
<p>If everything in SEO was purely on a page-by-page basis it would be enough to have a single page website that ticked all the boxes and expect it to rank in the top spot. But we all know in industries with any competition that&#8217;s simply not going to happen.</p>
<p>Good content on your site all adds up towards the overall SEO authority of the domain. Those weekly blogs might not be found a lot, but they&#8217;re a large part of the reason your homepage <strong>is.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A lot of SEO professionals are still selling their services based on a very outdated idea of how SEO works.</h2>
<p><strong>Anyone telling you they target a set number of keywords really isn&#8217;t doing SEO right.</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, an important terminology definition. The term <em>keywords</em> has meant a few different things over the past 20+ years in the Search Engine Optimisation industry. As such I prefer not to use it and try to use other words that do a better job of explaining what I mean. So when it comes to describing the concept of &#8216;phrases you want to rank highly with in search results&#8217; I use the term <em>search queries.</em> That does a much better job of conveying what we mean &#8211; the words people search for that your website gets found for.</p>
<p>Years ago SEO services would be sold based around (in part) a concept of how many search queries your site would be optimised for. But search doesn&#8217;t work like that anymore (and hasn&#8217;t for a number of years). It&#8217;s not as simple as having a list of a few terms we target &#8211; since Google brought their Rankbrain (artificial intelligence system) online for website indexing, everything is far more nuanced.</p>
<p>Technically a site can rank and be found for ANY of the words and terms on it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about a few of these issues before, so these articles might help give useful background:<br />
<a href="https://peterwm.com/googles-rankbrain-and-seo/">https://peterwm.com/googles-rankbrain-and-seo/</a><br />
<a href="https://peterwm.com/does-google-use-meta-keyword-tags/">https://peterwm.com/does-google-use-meta-keyword-tags/</a></p>
<p>SEO work is all about reinforcing your key content so it stand out for search engines. But anything within the content can (and often is) indexed by them. As an example if you ever get a chance to see the Google Search Console performance report you&#8217;ll often see hundreds of things a site is found for.</p>
<p>For example my site is clearly about being a WordPress SEO expert, and services around that. But in search results it comes up for over 1000 different searches, and a lot of those aren&#8217;t related to my core offerings. But they&#8217;re all related to words, brands or nouns I&#8217;ve used in the past. Googles does a great job of working out the context of your site, but with good SEO you can be found for just about anything.</p>

Links.</p>
<p>Back links, social links, white-hat links, black-hat links.</p>
<p>I called this post &#8220;Links &amp; <em>stuff</em>&#8221; because while the value of links is simple enough to understand, the jargon and terminology can make it seem more confusing than it is.</p>
<p>At its most simplistic—you really want as many links to your site as possible. You want them on blogs, local news sources, forums, social media, even from competitors sites (I&#8217;ve got a tip for that later on).</p>
<p>Because the more places on the Internet that link to you, the higher you get ranked in search engines. Google has always been very transparent about this, in fact the idea of indexing websites based on how many other places deem them useful enough to link to was their whole original idea. Which naturally has been replicated by other companies ad nauseum.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that&#8217;s it. But like everything with SEO, it&#8217;s the nuances that make a real difference.</p>
<p>A link to your online presence from a popular website dedicated to your industry is better than a little-read blog. Links from Facebook sit somewhere near the lower end of that scale, with Twitter slightly behind. It&#8217;s all worth having, but what you really want are high quality links on respected websites.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best way to get high quality links back to your site (backlinks, as they&#8217;re known) is to just ask for them. You&#8217;d be surprised how many professional blogs relish having guest bloggers—people who write once off entries for them, or perhaps even a short series of posts. It can take the stress of deadlines off them, or help them out when they can&#8217;t work owing to illness or preferably, a holiday. And of course they always link back to your site in the byline.</p>
<p>A quick way to generate backlinks that are from well known sites related to your field of expertise is to comment on posts that are already there. It&#8217;s quick and effective. In my case, I go to Google, search for &#8220;SEO&#8221;, and click on a recent high profile blog result. After quickly reading the article, I&#8217;ll post my thoughts in the comments, and link back to a related post on my own site. If I don&#8217;t have a related post, I make sure I do very quickly. It never hurts to have published my own ideas on a recent hot topic anyway.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the cheeky competitors site tip. Go to their site, and comment on <em>their</em> blogs. If possible, find an article there that relates to something you&#8217;ve already written about, and say so. &#8220;Interesting to see you finally catching up with this one, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for ages&#8221;. Cheeky. But include a link to your post, and not only do you get the SEO benefits, but you can hijack part of their readership.</p>
<p>Make sure you have Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin profiles that can be publicly accessed, and link to your posts from there.</p>
<p>Make sure other people can share your posts socially easily too; sharing buttons beneath each post on your website can make a real difference.</p>
<p>I maintain a separate blog, <a href="http://peter.webcraft.co" target="_blank">peter.webcraft.co,</a> which has the sole purpose of containing links to my own work. But (importantly) it has other short content there too, after all if it was nothing but links to my own work Google would see right through me.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the whitehat/blackhat concepts. In computer jargon whitehat is most simply defined as &#8220;not doing anything dodgy&#8221;. Blackhat is the opposite.</p>
<p>There are all manner of techniques for building backlinks to up your search engine ratings. Anything you pay for is usually blackhat. Not illegal, but not exactly cricket either.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. Link pyramids. These used to be very popular, and at times quite costly. You&#8217;d pay someone to create an army of low-level links on social networks and lesser known blogs. Then those would link to more popular sites, but again these were all manufactured by the vendor. Then they&#8217;d point to a few really highly ranked site, and in turn they would point to your pages.</p>
<p>You were at the top of the pyramid, enjoying the view from the top of search engines rankings.</p>
<p>Then the search engines realised what was happening, and wrote highly intelligent algorithms to find these pyramids, and penalise them. A lot. I&#8217;m managing SEO for a client who had to move domain names just to get away from their previous ill-gotten reputation (earned before my involvement, I hasten to add). They had thousands of links, felt at the top of their game, then woke up one morning to find in the eyes of the world wide web, they barely existed anymore.</p>
<p>And then the link building industry moved to a link wheels, and again the cycle began, only to fall later.</p>
<p>And this is a very important lesson I can&#8217;t impart strongly enough. SEO is a long game, because it should be organic.</p>
<p>Yes, you can optimise your code, your site speed, your images, etc. Yes, you can spread the word by sharing links to your site on other related blogs, but that&#8217;s all real people doing real things. Have great content that people will want to engage with, and share.</p>
<p>But if you try to cheat the system, you&#8217;ll be slapped for it. And for many of us, with so much of our business conducted online, a slap can send us under.</p>
<p>Organic growth. Humans interacting. It&#8217;s what the Internet was supposed to be about. Search engines make unexpected guardians of that dream, but when it comes to being found online, they hold all the keys.</p>

<p>This is probably the most technical of all the posts that make up my SEO primer, so by way of introduction, I&#8217;ll simply say the following are a variety of things within your site&#8217;s code that are helpful for optimisation. You may not be someone who ever touches your site&#8217;s code, but these are good things to know about so you can check your developer is doing their job right. 🙂</p>
<p>As much as I love spinning a good narrative, bullet points are going to be our friend in this piece.</p>
<ol>
<li>Meta tags.<br />
I&#8217;m getting these out of the way early, because they&#8217;re controversial. That&#8217;s because the way these are used is often misunderstood owing to historical changes. Basically, they used to be really important, and the first thing old-school search engines looked at. Then the spiders got more clever, and started to look to make sure your page&#8217;s text contained all the keywords you were using in the meta. Then they realised they could do away with the meta and just scan your text. For this reason, a lot of SEO (ahem) &#8220;experts&#8221; will tell you they&#8217;re not necessary. That&#8217;s bulls**t basically.<a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=79812" target="_blank"><br />
This page</a> documents Google&#8217;s use of the &#8220;description&#8221; tag, which they do look at and use. Other search engines use them in varying ways too. The description and keyword (and author!) tags are all worth using, and using well. Make sure they tie-in with your copy.</li>
<li>Alt tags.<br />
Search engines are certainly getting better at seeing what your site&#8217;s images are, but it&#8217;s far from perfect. Alt tags are the things that let the browser know what your image is representing, and therefore really important for SEO. I always make sure that my images contain tags that say not only what the image is of, but also the name of the page/entry it&#8217;s appearing in. That way the page name is repeated in the code too, which boosts it&#8217;s importance within the page.</li>
<li>nofollow.<br />
About 10 years ago, people had things called doorway pages that were nothing but links to other pages in their sites. It was a dirty trick and got stamped all over by the search engine gods. However, you know how WordPress in particular creates pages for monthly archives, category archives, even tag archives? Well funnily enough they look a lot to spiders like doorway pages, containing tonnes of links (including all the sidebar links) to pages that just link to other pages en masse. I&#8217;ve measured this myself, and yes, you will get penalised for them. I have most of my links on this site set up with the nofollow rule, meaning the good search engines (technically spiders don&#8217;t have to respect this rule, but the big boys all do) will not follow it and count it as a link.<br />
I want them to see all my pages, but not to see them all a hundred times. I opt to leave category links being followed, but NOT monthly archives or tags.</li>
<li>minify.<br />
This is just a trick to get all the unnecessary spaces and characters out of your code. It&#8217;s particularly useful for javascript and CSS, but your output HTML is worth shrinking too. There are tools out there that do it at load time, but that can place a burden on your server. I love <a href="http://www.cleancss.com/" target="_blank">this tool</a> which takes all your CSS and merges parts where it can, and will (if you ask it to) minify the hell out of it.<br />
If you keep the page load time down, Google will rank you up.</li>
<li>Javascript at the bottom.<br />
Place all the Javascript you can at the bottom of your page&#8217;s code. Again, it&#8217;s a speed thing.</li>
<li>Make it clean.<br />
Don&#8217;t use tables unless it&#8217;s for, you know, a table. CSS has reigned supreme for a long time now. Don&#8217;t repeat attributes within tags. Check for redundant code. Consider taking out all those comments you put in while you were coding the site in the first place. Basically, give your code a nice, long bath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically, your code underpins everything. Make it Search Engine Optimisation friendly and you&#8217;ll be much better ranked for it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The short answer is &#8220;pretty bland&#8221;.</p>
<p>While photo recognition, and language techniques are getting more advanced all the time, the raw data most search engines (including Google and Bing) see when they do a first pass on your site is very sparse.</p>
<p>Text will almost always be the most important Search Engine Optimisation feature you have (buy all the link pyramids you want, but if your site doesn&#8217;t have key, unique, relevant writing you&#8217;re achieving nothing) and using software like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29" target="_blank">Lynx</a> is an excellent way to test it.</p>
<p>Lynx as a browser pre-dates pretty-much every browser you&#8217;re likely to have on your computer, and is the browser a lot of search engine spiders use.</p>
<p>You can use it on Linux easily, or save yourself the hassle as use a web based version:<br />
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html" target="_blank">http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html</a></p>
<p>Check to see that the text on your site is readable in it, that your menu structure shows (and works), and that the text it does show <em>makes sense.</em> That might seem odd at first, but  you&#8217;d be surprised how many sites do not make sense when viewed in simple text (i.e. they rely too much on graphics to do their talking) and search engines like to read things they can understand; that a human will make sense of easily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little SEO tool in what needs to be a big arsenal.</p>
