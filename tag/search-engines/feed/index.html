Links.</p>
<p>Back links, social links, white-hat links, black-hat links.</p>
<p>I called this post &#8220;Links &amp; <em>stuff</em>&#8221; because while the value of links is simple enough to understand, the jargon and terminology can make it seem more confusing than it is.</p>
<p>At its most simplistic—you really want as many links to your site as possible. You want them on blogs, local news sources, forums, social media, even from competitors sites (I&#8217;ve got a tip for that later on).</p>
<p>Because the more places on the Internet that link to you, the higher you get ranked in search engines. Google has always been very transparent about this, in fact the idea of indexing websites based on how many other places deem them useful enough to link to was their whole original idea. Which naturally has been replicated by other companies ad nauseum.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that&#8217;s it. But like everything with SEO, it&#8217;s the nuances that make a real difference.</p>
<p>A link to your online presence from a popular website dedicated to your industry is better than a little-read blog. Links from Facebook sit somewhere near the lower end of that scale, with Twitter slightly behind. It&#8217;s all worth having, but what you really want are high quality links on respected websites.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best way to get high quality links back to your site (backlinks, as they&#8217;re known) is to just ask for them. You&#8217;d be surprised how many professional blogs relish having guest bloggers—people who write once off entries for them, or perhaps even a short series of posts. It can take the stress of deadlines off them, or help them out when they can&#8217;t work owing to illness or preferably, a holiday. And of course they always link back to your site in the byline.</p>
<p>A quick way to generate backlinks that are from well known sites related to your field of expertise is to comment on posts that are already there. It&#8217;s quick and effective. In my case, I go to Google, search for &#8220;SEO&#8221;, and click on a recent high profile blog result. After quickly reading the article, I&#8217;ll post my thoughts in the comments, and link back to a related post on my own site. If I don&#8217;t have a related post, I make sure I do very quickly. It never hurts to have published my own ideas on a recent hot topic anyway.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the cheeky competitors site tip. Go to their site, and comment on <em>their</em> blogs. If possible, find an article there that relates to something you&#8217;ve already written about, and say so. &#8220;Interesting to see you finally catching up with this one, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for ages&#8221;. Cheeky. But include a link to your post, and not only do you get the SEO benefits, but you can hijack part of their readership.</p>
<p>Make sure you have Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin profiles that can be publicly accessed, and link to your posts from there.</p>
<p>Make sure other people can share your posts socially easily too; sharing buttons beneath each post on your website can make a real difference.</p>
<p>I maintain a separate blog, <a href="http://peter.webcraft.co" target="_blank">peter.webcraft.co,</a> which has the sole purpose of containing links to my own work. But (importantly) it has other short content there too, after all if it was nothing but links to my own work Google would see right through me.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the whitehat/blackhat concepts. In computer jargon whitehat is most simply defined as &#8220;not doing anything dodgy&#8221;. Blackhat is the opposite.</p>
<p>There are all manner of techniques for building backlinks to up your search engine ratings. Anything you pay for is usually blackhat. Not illegal, but not exactly cricket either.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. Link pyramids. These used to be very popular, and at times quite costly. You&#8217;d pay someone to create an army of low-level links on social networks and lesser known blogs. Then those would link to more popular sites, but again these were all manufactured by the vendor. Then they&#8217;d point to a few really highly ranked site, and in turn they would point to your pages.</p>
<p>You were at the top of the pyramid, enjoying the view from the top of search engines rankings.</p>
<p>Then the search engines realised what was happening, and wrote highly intelligent algorithms to find these pyramids, and penalise them. A lot. I&#8217;m managing SEO for a client who had to move domain names just to get away from their previous ill-gotten reputation (earned before my involvement, I hasten to add). They had thousands of links, felt at the top of their game, then woke up one morning to find in the eyes of the world wide web, they barely existed anymore.</p>
<p>And then the link building industry moved to a link wheels, and again the cycle began, only to fall later.</p>
<p>And this is a very important lesson I can&#8217;t impart strongly enough. SEO is a long game, because it should be organic.</p>
<p>Yes, you can optimise your code, your site speed, your images, etc. Yes, you can spread the word by sharing links to your site on other related blogs, but that&#8217;s all real people doing real things. Have great content that people will want to engage with, and share.</p>
<p>But if you try to cheat the system, you&#8217;ll be slapped for it. And for many of us, with so much of our business conducted online, a slap can send us under.</p>
<p>Organic growth. Humans interacting. It&#8217;s what the Internet was supposed to be about. Search engines make unexpected guardians of that dream, but when it comes to being found online, they hold all the keys.</p>

<p>This is probably the most technical of all the posts that make up my SEO primer, so by way of introduction, I&#8217;ll simply say the following are a variety of things within your site&#8217;s code that are helpful for optimisation. You may not be someone who ever touches your site&#8217;s code, but these are good things to know about so you can check your developer is doing their job right. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>As much as I love spinning a good narrative, bullet points are going to be our friend in this piece.</p>
<ol>
<li>Meta tags.<br />
I&#8217;m getting these out of the way early, because they&#8217;re controversial. That&#8217;s because the way these are used is often misunderstood owing to historical changes. Basically, they used to be really important, and the first thing old-school search engines looked at. Then the spiders got more clever, and started to look to make sure your page&#8217;s text contained all the keywords you were using in the meta. Then they realised they could do away with the meta and just scan your text. For this reason, a lot of SEO (ahem) &#8220;experts&#8221; will tell you they&#8217;re not necessary. That&#8217;s bulls**t basically.<a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=79812" target="_blank"><br />
This page</a> documents Google&#8217;s use of the &#8220;description&#8221; tag, which they do look at and use. Other search engines use them in varying ways too. The description and keyword (and author!) tags are all worth using, and using well. Make sure they tie-in with your copy.</li>
<li>Alt tags.<br />
Search engines are certainly getting better at seeing what your site&#8217;s images are, but it&#8217;s far from perfect. Alt tags are the things that let the browser know what your image is representing, and therefore really important for SEO. I always make sure that my images contain tags that say not only what the image is of, but also the name of the page/entry it&#8217;s appearing in. That way the page name is repeated in the code too, which boosts it&#8217;s importance within the page.</li>
<li>nofollow.<br />
About 10 years ago, people had things called doorway pages that were nothing but links to other pages in their sites. It was a dirty trick and got stamped all over by the search engine gods. However, you know how WordPress in particular creates pages for monthly archives, category archives, even tag archives? Well funnily enough they look a lot to spiders like doorway pages, containing tonnes of links (including all the sidebar links) to pages that just link to other pages en masse. I&#8217;ve measured this myself, and yes, you will get penalised for them. I have most of my links on this site set up with the nofollow rule, meaning the good search engines (technically spiders don&#8217;t have to respect this rule, but the big boys all do) will not follow it and count it as a link.<br />
I want them to see all my pages, but not to see them all a hundred times. I opt to leave category links being followed, but NOT monthly archives or tags.</li>
<li>minify.<br />
This is just a trick to get all the unnecessary spaces and characters out of your code. It&#8217;s particularly useful for javascript and CSS, but your output HTML is worth shrinking too. There are tools out there that do it at load time, but that can place a burden on your server. I love <a href="http://www.cleancss.com/" target="_blank">this tool</a> which takes all your CSS and merges parts where it can, and will (if you ask it to) minify the hell out of it.<br />
If you keep the page load time down, Google will rank you up.</li>
<li>Javascript at the bottom.<br />
Place all the Javascript you can at the bottom of your page&#8217;s code. Again, it&#8217;s a speed thing.</li>
<li>Make it clean.<br />
Don&#8217;t use tables unless it&#8217;s for, you know, a table. CSS has reigned supreme for a long time now. Don&#8217;t repeat attributes within tags. Check for redundant code. Consider taking out all those comments you put in while you were coding the site in the first place. Basically, give your code a nice, long bath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically, your code underpins everything. Make it Search Engine Optimisation friendly and you&#8217;ll be much better ranked for it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The short answer is &#8220;pretty bland&#8221;.</p>
<p>While photo recognition, and language techniques are getting more advanced all the time, the raw data most search engines (including Google and Bing) see when they do a first pass on your site is very sparse.</p>
<p>Text will almost always be the most important Search Engine Optimisation feature you have (buy all the link pyramids you want, but if your site doesn&#8217;t have key, unique, relevant writing you&#8217;re achieving nothing) and using software like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29" target="_blank">Lynx</a> is an excellent way to test it.</p>
<p>Lynx as a browser pre-dates pretty-much every browser you&#8217;re likely to have on your computer, and is the browser a lot of search engine spiders use.</p>
<p>You can use it on Linux easily, or save yourself the hassle as use a web based version:<br />
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html" target="_blank">http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html</a></p>
<p>Check to see that the text on your site is readable in it, that your menu structure shows (and works), and that the text it does show <em>makes sense.</em> That might seem odd at first, but  you&#8217;d be surprised how many sites do not make sense when viewed in simple text (i.e. they rely too much on graphics to do their talking) and search engines like to read things they can understand; that a human will make sense of easily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little SEO tool in what needs to be a big arsenal.</p>
