That statement is a little over-simplified because the process of moving really takes a lot longer than the single day the truck is filled with your stuff.</p>
<p>In some ways we&#8217;re still moving, but telling ourselves we&#8217;ve settled (or at least are settling) into the house we plan for our kids to grow up in.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have bought a house in this economy, in our favourite town (Glastonbury). There <em>was</em> some fairly well-attended shindig in the area around the time we moved, but by and large it stayed out of our way.</p>
<p>The day of the move was itself stressful&mdash;as they tend to be. Everything took longer than planned; we got everything in only to realise we&#8217;d designated the wrong rooms and needed to move it all about, and just where the hell are my clean pants anyway.</p>
<p>And now I find myself settled in my office, with my computer on, speakers operational, second monitor shining it&#8217;s light upon me, and I&#8217;m struck by how reliable the net can be.</p>
<p>Sure, Facebook can&#8217;t make up its mind how it wants to dress itself, email servers can be a bit of an arse sometimes, and Amazon is still convenient, if not a bit ethically questionable.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s all right there. The methods I use to interact with friends and family across the world, the means to put dinner on my families table&mdash;they haven&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p>My surrounds have, but I have this little window through which the world doesn&#8217;t look so different.</p>
<p>And while technology is mercifully always adapting, it can also function as as a dependable &#8220;room with a view&#8221; from any house, train, or airport lounge.</p>
<p>In turn I reflect on my own website. While I was packing boxes, only to unpack them the next day, and helping move heavy bits of furniture that I&#8217;m sure we paid someone else to carry about, my website was viewed by 200 different people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve carved out a piece of digital real estate, that even in my absence, when my mind is firmly elsewhere, still attracts people from all manner of places. It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m happy with it.</p>
