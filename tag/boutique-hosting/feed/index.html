								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a huge number of webhosts to choose from. Prices vary widely, which isn&#8217;t too surprising because quality does too.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just assume the cheaper web service is right for you. Here&#8217;s a guide to some of the players:</p>
<p><strong>Hostgator</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=webcraftco" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1104"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Services-Reseller-Hosting-VPS-Hosting-and-Dedicated-Servers-by-HostGator-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Services-Reseller-Hosting-VPS-Hosting-and-Dedicated-Servers-by-HostGator-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg 150w, http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Services-Reseller-Hosting-VPS-Hosting-and-Dedicated-Servers-by-HostGator-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>From the long list of cheap options to host your website, they&#8217;re certainly my recommendation. Their user interface is easy to get your head around, and their after sales care is pretty good.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much more to say about Hostgator really; it&#8217;s very competitively priced, and does what it says on the tin.</p>
<p><a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=webcraftco" target="_blank">Hostgator</a></p>
<p><strong>GoDaddy</strong></p>
<p><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1105"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Domain-Names-UK-Domain-Name-Registration-Services-GoDaddy-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Domain-Names-UK-Domain-Name-Registration-Services-GoDaddy-150x150.jpg 150w, http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Domain-Names-UK-Domain-Name-Registration-Services-GoDaddy.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Basically, just don&#8217;t. Never ever.</p>
<p>GoDaddy aren&#8217;t so much in the hosting business, as they are in the spamming business. Having an account with them isn&#8217;t too different from paying someone to send you constant emails that you don&#8217;t want.</p>
<p>If you want more information see my case study on how to tell at a glance that <a title="How to spot good after-sale customer care" href="http://pwmxx.github.io/how-to-spot-good-after-sale-customer-care/" target="_blank">Godaddy doesn&#8217;t prioritise existing customers.</a></p>
<p><strong>Bluehost</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/webcraftdotco" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1102"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Domain-Names-eCommerce-Bluehost.com-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Domain-Names-eCommerce-Bluehost.com-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg 150w, http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Web-Hosting-Domain-Names-eCommerce-Bluehost.com-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Bluehost are an OK, <em>very</em> cheap option.</p>
<p>They have some unusual clauses in their contract that gives them the right to cancel any account they deem inappropriate. And being owned by a strict Mormon family, they&#8217;ve been known to block sex-education websites used by schools simply for having the word &#8220;sex&#8221; in them. That seems to be a fairly isolated incident, but funny enough to mention.</p>
<p>Their after sales support isn&#8217;t great, and they tend to put a lot of users on each server which can impact the performance of your site. Basically they&#8217;re an exercise in &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221;. And as I say, they&#8217;re very cheap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/webcraftdotco" target="_blank">Bluehost</a></p>
<p><strong>Pete&#8217;s Boutique</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://pwmxx.github.io/services/web-hosting/" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1082"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/william-morris-wallpaper-boutique-webhost-peter-mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Say what? It&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve created my own boutique hosting service. It&#8217;s based on my ethos that I want to make sure my clients get the best online presence they can.</p>
<p>Most web hosts keep costs down by protecting their server processing overheads, and turn off a bunch of features that can really improve the speed and reliability of your site. I turn them all on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small, personal service that treats you as a real person with real dreams for your business, rather than just a line in a database somewhere.</p>
<p><a title="Web hosting" href="http://pwmxx.github.io/services/web-hosting/">Read all about it here.</a></p>
<p><strong>VPS.NET</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://vps.net/" target="_blank"><img  title="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1103"  alt="Web hosting comparison Peter Mahoney"  src="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cloud-VPS-Server-Hosting-by-VPS.NET-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cloud-VPS-Server-Hosting-by-VPS.NET-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney-150x150.jpg 150w, http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cloud-VPS-Server-Hosting-by-VPS.NET-web-hosting-comparison-Peter-Mahoney.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>I really like their service, although they&#8217;re certainly the most expensive in this comparison. And their system is a little confusing; it&#8217;s geared towards having people sign up for full virtual servers rather than just hosting websites.</p>
<p>There is an option to do the latter, called Cloud Sites, and starts at £13 a month but quickly starts to rack up to £40.</p>
<p>Their support is excellent, which is helpful because the slightly confusing nature of their interface means you&#8217;ll be using it quite a bit at the start.</p>

<p>If you read my blog regularly you&#8217;ll know Google in particular takes page speed into account when ranking your website.</p>
<p>But did you know research suggests any page that takes longer than 4 seconds to load starts to lose business? And anything over 7 costs you most of your traffic? Visitors to your site simply hit the back button to get out of there.</p>
<p>Google and Yahoo! both have tools that show you how well your site is performing for speed, and what you can do to improve it. They&#8217;re called Page Speed and Yslow, and you can test them both at once using this tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://gtmetrix.com" target="_blank">http://gtmetrix.com</a></p>
<p>Just put in the URL for your site, and hit go. In a few seconds you&#8217;ll see exactly how well your site is, or isn&#8217;t, doing.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
<p>I recently sat down to improve the speed of bordersundials.co.uk. It was woefully slow, with a 7.4 second initial load time, and &#8220;C&#8221; grades for both Page Speed and Yslow.</p>
<p>After I&#8217;d finished with it, I&#8217;m thrilled to say it&#8217;s loading in 1.84 seconds, with two &#8220;A&#8221; ratings.</p>
<p>As part of this I also suggested the website be moved to my boutique hosting solution, which is configured and tailored to include all kinds of speed extras that regular ISPs turn off.</p>
<p>Test your site, get in touch, and let&#8217;s improve it.</p>
