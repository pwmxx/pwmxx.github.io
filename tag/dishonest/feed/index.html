								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-205" title="buy_twitter_followers_online" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/buy_twitter_followers_online-150x150.png" alt="Buy Twitter followers online" width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;m breaking my own rules, so you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>I maintain, and always have, that quality is the key component to any online community. A community of 200 people, with regular contributions from 90% of them, is a far better experience for your users, members, and clients, than 20,000 with .09% engagement.</p>
<p>Strong communities build strong reliances for your brand. I tell everyone this. I regularly check my online tribe to ensure it&#8217;s filled with real, engaged people.</p>
<p>Having said that, I just purchased 30,000 Twitter followers. I&#8217;m saying it openly, because it&#8217;s all a big test. An experiment of epic quantity.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the logic—there are all sorts of places selling bot followers for Twitter (&#8220;bot&#8221; means these aren&#8217;t real people, they only bolster your follower numbers) and just as many blog posts from people saying they&#8217;re a waste of time.</p>
<p>But of the two dozen bloggers I responded to, <em>not one of them</em> has done it themselves. I can&#8217;t get my hands on enough unbiased, experiential evidence to say for sure that they&#8217;re a waste of time.</p>
<p>I expect they are, I&#8217;ve always said so, but I want to be able to say it with the confidence that comes from having made the mistake first hand.</p>
<p>The only possible positive I can conceive of, is that there are users who might see your tweet retreated by an actual Twitter user, click your profile, and then feel assured that you&#8217;re worth following because thousands of other people already do—even though they really don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a trick of building confidence in yourself by, basically, pretending lots of people already <em>do</em> see you as an opinion leader.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s dishonest, sure. And I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any match for organic community growth. But I&#8217;ve done it now, and I&#8217;m telling you about it so it&#8217;s not quite as dishonest.</p>
<p>Naturally I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes. On the off-chance it <em>does</em> pay off, well, <a href="http://twitter.com/petermahoney" target="_blank">I&#8217;ll tweet you</a> all about it. All 30,001 of you.</p>
