<p>Google Apps (used for business email, file sharing, calendaring etc.) is now rebranded as G Suite.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a bad mid-90s R&amp;B group. (Try as I might, I can&#8217;t forget &#8220;Rappin&#8217; 4-Tay&#8221;.)*</p>
<p>In their official blog post, Google said this is more in keeping more with their mission to provide a series of tools businesses use to further their own purposes. Basically rather than a series of individual applications coming together they see it as a stock set of tools within one Google system.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Google Apps proved to be an invaluable tools for companies, schools and universities, and I do hope G Suite continues to build on and improve those systems.</p>
<p>But I do have one niggling concern in the back of my mind. Google Apps used to be free for small firms, then overnight all new accounts were subject to a subscription fee. Existing free accounts continued to run with charge &#8211; but any change to Apps brings a fear they might start to charge for those grandfathered accounts.</p>
<p>And with a change this big, well &#8211; Google Apps keep free accounts, but will G Suite?</p>
