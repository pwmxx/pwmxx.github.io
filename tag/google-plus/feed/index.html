The only Google app you&#8217;ll not be able to access is Gmail. which is fine because your email is already managed elsewhere.</p>
<p>This saves you having to have a Gmail account that you need to check in addition to your current email. This is great for me, I&#8217;ve already got three addresses and the thought of an extra email is a bit much.</p>
<p>Rather than going through the &#8220;Create and account&#8221; option you&#8217;ll see when you sign up for a Google service like Goggle+, go here instead:</p>
<p><a href="https://accounts.google.com/newaccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://accounts.google.com/newaccount</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note the option &#8220;I prefer to use my current email address&#8221;&#8211;use that!</p>
<p>Like most things, it&#8217;s easy when you know how. Or in this case, <em>where.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It goes without saying that we love Google Authorship, and the snippets produced by having it set up.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, here&#8217;s all you need to know in one photo:<img  title="Google authorship in the code Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1243"  alt="Google authorship in the code Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2013/09/peterwm.local-google-authorship.png" width="506" height="140" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2013/09/peterwm.local-google-authorship.png 506w, https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2013/09/peterwm.local-google-authorship-300x83.png 300w, https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2013/09/peterwm.local-google-authorship-500x138.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></p>
<p>Having this set up grabs peoples&#8217; attention.</p>
<p>Part of the process of setting these up is to have a link on your pages back to your Google Plus profile. All the guidance from Google, and therefore most online sources, is to have an icon or short piece of text that links to your profile.</p>
<p>Not everyone wants to link to their Google+ page. And for good reason; a lot of website authors only have G+ accounts for the sake of getting these authorship snippets working. They certainly don&#8217;t want to drive visitors to a social profile they aren&#8217;t actively using.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a solution I worked out myself. As far as I know, I&#8217;m the first to be publishing this.</p>
<p>Simply drop this code into your website, anywhere at all. It doesn&#8217;t display anything on the siteâ€”it just sits in the code, but works 100% as a Google Author link.</p>
<p><em>&lt;a href=&#8221;your-profile-url?rel=author&#8221; /&gt;</em></p>
<p>So for example mine is:</p>
<p><em>&lt;a href=&#8221;https://plus.google.com/u/1/110002801838494280534?rel=author&#8221; /&gt;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img  title="Google snippets, keep an eye out for changes Peter Mahoney" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-941"  alt="Google snippets, keep an eye out for changes Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2013/05/peter-mahoney-google-snippet-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" />I love Google snippets. In fact, I <em>adore</em> them. You can see an example of one just here, a picture of my face next to my search results.</p>
<p>They get clicked on more often, and carry a heavier weight in the minds of users. You want them, basically. <strong>Badly.</strong></p>
<p>Mine went away temporarily, and it pays to stay on top of this sort of thing. Google slightly changed the way they interpret a site&#8217;s code when deciding if and what a snippet might be of.</p>
<p>In this instance, I was relying on having my Google Plus account set up to relate to this site, but suddenly needed to have a link back from the site to my <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/110002801838494280534/posts" target="_blank">Google Plus profile,</a> in the form of an author tag in the website&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>It took all of 90 seconds to fix. But in the eyes of the casual searcher, I&#8217;m back punching with the big boys.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get ahead with snippets on your site, <a title="Contact" href="https://pwmxx.github.io/contact/">be sure to let me know.</a></p>
