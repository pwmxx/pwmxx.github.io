There&#8217;s a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there.</p>
<p>When search engines first came out (pre-Google), the idea that they could read a whole website was out of reach. It would take too long, require they store too much data, and generally there needed to be a quick, simple approach to scanning a website. The simplest of the simplest techniques was &#8220;meta keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>This was a small piece of code that lived behind the scenes of a site, that listed all the keywords a site owner wanted their site to rank with. The list was delineated by a comma, so looked something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;meta name=&#8221;keywords&#8221; content=&#8221;SEO, search engine optimisation, WordPress&#8221; /&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>This method was open to huge amounts of abuse on the part of a website owner. There was nothing stopping someone using keywords which were known to rank well, but didn&#8217;t even appear in their website. We started seeing tens of thousands of search results which were really a bait and switch, and it was eroding from the quality of the internet.</p>
<p>Google came along, and was one of the first search engines to really have a strong ethos behind it, in that they wanted to find a way to keep the internet useful, and digitally clean &amp; tidy.</p>
<p>The solution was to index every site&#8217;s entire contents, scanning all the text that a real human could actually read, and working out based on sentence structure, density of nouns etc what a website was really about.</p>
<p>The next step was to start overlooking the meta keyword tag entirely.</p>
<p>And that was about a decade ago. Other major search engines followed suit, and as a result that list of keywords has been defunct and totally ignored for the best part of a decade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for a host of reasons (many SEO &#8220;experts&#8221; don&#8217;t actually keep ahead of best practice, or are too happy to just do whatever their clients ask without explaining the process, or just that keyword lists entered the collectively consciousness at a formative time in the internet&#8217;s history) people still think they&#8217;re going to be useful.</p>
<p>One of the most popular SEO plugins for WordPress actually says next to the &#8220;Use keywords?&#8221; field, &#8220;I can&#8217;t think why you&#8217;d want to know. The search engines don&#8217;t&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sadly a lot of people get caught up on these, and their focus disappears from what is important to something that absolutely is not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not helped by the number of places that lists of words and phrases ARE still used, like Google Adsense for example. We also track our website&#8217;s analytics based on what search queries people found us with, etc.</p>
<p>I prefer to call these things &#8220;search terms&#8221;, or occasionally &#8220;key terms&#8221;. I try to steer clear of the (possible) synonym &#8220;keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what I do in this regard is to look at your site as Google et al try to, (pretty well) as a human being. I read your site to see what it&#8217;s really about. I then run tests just like they do to see what words and phrases you use most often, and check that those do a good job of describing what your site is actually about. Most of the time, as long as someone has written their website from their own knowledge and experience of their industry or topic, these match just fine.</p>
<p>Occasionally I find someone thinks they have a site about, say, &#8220;window fitting&#8221;, but really it comes across as being about &#8220;buy my product&#8221;. You can imagine how that might happen, but it&#8217;s not want the search companies want to see so it&#8217;s not what we want to give them.</p>
<p>If I come across a discrepancy like that, I let my clients know that they need to rethink their content asap.</p>
<p>As long as they do match, I make sure I reinforce those terms everywhere we know Google et al want to see them. In image tags, in the description tag, in the page titles.</p>
<p>So, the short answer to a long history is let me take care of that&#8211;if I need to alert you to an issue I&#8217;ll let you know, and please don&#8217;t be surprised if you look at your site&#8217;s code when I&#8217;ve done and there is no outdated &#8220;keywords&#8221; code.</p>

Blogging is <strong>the very best</strong> thing you can do for your search engine optimisation. If you are not blogging, you are ignoring the biggest factor in improving your placement in their listings.</p>
<p>Quite simply, if you put all the other tips and tricks aside, the real key to SEO is regular, original content.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really simple. Google et al want to see content written by humans, for humans. So write some.</p>
<p>1. Regular<br />
Search engines work out how often to scan your website and specific pages within that based on how often it has seen those change in the past.</p>
<p>If your pages are all fairly static (meaning there aren&#8217;t any elements on them that change regularly, like text or images) the search giants (Google, Bing, Yahoo!) will stop coming. Google might only index your site every few months.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some massive missed opportunities there. Not only will your site be deemed to have a low Page Rank (not very important in the search results) but even if you do update with some new amazing, original content—it might not be noticed until it&#8217;s well out of date.</p>
<p>2. Original<br />
Search Engines are clever. Google is adept at scanning text and knowing if it&#8217;s the sort of thing a human would read, rather than a bunch of words strung together to try to fool it. They also know very easily if your work is a copy and paste from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Apart from simply making money, search engines all have an ethos behind them. Google for example wants to see a helpful, information rich Internet that answers users&#8217; queries quickly and efficiently. So they rank sites they believe fit into that plan more highly than those that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If your site has too much content pasted from elsewhere, you do not fit into this ideal.</p>
<p>What does is original content. Something <em>you&#8217;ve</em> written (or someone else has written exclusively on your behalf).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as hard as it sounds. Pick a subject that relates to your business. I do this with my blog all the time—and then in your head explain it as you would to one of your customers. Type out your side of the conversation, and you&#8217;re basically done.</p>
<p>3. Keywords<br />
Before you even ask the question, the answer is yes. You do want to target keywords in your blogging. Bear in mind that as long as you&#8217;re writing on topic, they&#8217;ll come out anyway. You want people to find you because of the sort of products and services you offer, so as long as you&#8217;re writing about the subject you sell, they&#8217;ll flow naturally.</p>
<p>Rather than ensuring I type specific words, I do my best to hit a variety of terms.</p>
<p>The sentence you just read is a case in point—it would have seemed normal to use &#8220;words&#8221; in there twice; where I did and then again at the end of the sentence. By using &#8220;terms&#8221; the second time, I&#8217;m improving my SEO because I&#8217;ll be indexed for both &#8220;words&#8221; and &#8220;terms&#8221;, rather than just one of them.</p>
<p>I do this all the time. Synonyms are are important but often overlooked aspect of SEO. A potential client might enter either &#8220;social media&#8221; or &#8220;social networking&#8221; for instance, and if that&#8217;s your industry you want them to find you regardless of the phrase they&#8217;re most familiar with.</p>
<p>Search engine optimisation is all about people—people finding you. Make sure you&#8217;re giving them what they need to do precisely that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take a good look and tell me what you see (in an unusual stylistic move for me, you can click these images to see them full size):</p>
<p><a href="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu1.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-750"  title="Spot the difference Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu1-500x38.png"  alt="Spot the difference Peter Mahoney"  width="500" height="38" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu1-500x38.png 500w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu1-300x22.png 300w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu1.png 775w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu2.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-751"  title="Spot the difference Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu2-500x38.png"  alt="Spot the difference Peter Mahoney"  width="500" height="38" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu2-500x38.png 500w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu2-300x22.png 300w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/menu2.png 774w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The top image is a menu made up of images. Which means not only does loading the site require loading a bunch of extra jpg, png or gif files, but much more importantly search engines don&#8217;t know what they say. To make matters worse, this particular site didn&#8217;t even use alt tags*.</p>
<p>Plus if you do click on it to see the full version, you&#8217;ll notice the text isn&#8217;t even well formed, it&#8217;s pixelated and ugly.</p>
<p>The bottom image is the same menu, with a tiny one-pixel-wide image (well, actually two one-pixel-wide images) repeating. The text is just that, text. So search engines can scan it, and see what they say.</p>
<p>The implications of that is you can have your pages&#8217; headings, which should sum up the content of your site pretty well, on <em>every</em> page. Those headings should be written to include your keywords, and you <em>really</em> want those on every page!</p>
<p>And thanks to modern font smoothing on mainstream operating systems, they look a lot nicer.</p>
<p>I cannot fathom why this menu was originally made entirely with graphics. Unless it was just for the roll-over effect, which did nothing but make the text turn orange.</p>
<p>Which it still does, thanks to some really simple CSS.</p>
<p>* Please note, alt tags are actually not tags at all, but attributes of the img (image) tag. I really should adjust and start using the right terminology, but when you&#8217;ve been at this for 17 years, well, old habits die hard.</p>
