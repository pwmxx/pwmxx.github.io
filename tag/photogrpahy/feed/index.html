This is such a project!</p>
<p>David Burnett from Image Control Photography wanted an update for his site, which was based on a very well-known (but it turns out not cross-browser compatible) WordPress theme. He works in the hotly contested wedding photography market, and needed to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I made one myself that is a lot more dependable than the one he bought off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m more of a red and black person and the colour scheme might not be to my personal tastesâ€”but everything is well laid out, easy to read, fully responsive (even on Windows Mobile IE) and has a good mix of high quality photography with text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have a glass of wine to celebrate this one.</p>

<p><img  title="New site: Essex Wedding Photographers Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1400"  alt="New site: Essex Wedding Photographers Peter Mahoney"  src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-440x585.jpg" width="440" height="585" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-440x585.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-180x240.jpg 180w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers.jpg 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" />PS, Dave, my one confession is for some reason, the way I type doesn&#8217;t allow me to ever spell &#8220;photography&#8221; correctly. So if you find any references in the site to &#8220;photogr<strong>pa</strong>hy&#8221;, that&#8217;s entirely my fault.</p>
