								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My WordPress site is so fast, I’m not even sure I can call it WordPress anymore.</h2>
<p><strong>Static site generators are awesome.</strong></p>
<p>They create blindingly fast sites, with very few drawbacks (more on those later).</p>
<p>But I’ve been using WordPress since it was a small blogging platform call b2. I’m used to it, I like it, and already have a swag of sites built on it for myself; not just my clients.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">I work in SEO</a> speed is really crucial to what I do. I do a lot of caching and optimisation work for people, but wanted to see what would happen if I really pushed the envelope out.</p>
<p>Initially I was keen to make a front-end that pulled data out of a basic WordPress install using JSON. I set up a proof-of-concept successfully, but wasn’t so keen on remaking all my layouts and front-end design from scratch for it. Besides, basic things like the WordPress menu editor, text widgets etc. are something I very much enjoy using.</p>
<p>I did some research, and came across a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP2Static.</a> It’s a slick plugin that basically does just what I wanted – it packages up WordPress sites as static sites you can deploy anywhere. With a bit of configuring you can actually use it to output to a folder on the same server, and use some basic .htaccess rules so that becomes the public facing side of things.</p>
<p>Which is cool, but I wanted to go for MAXIMUM SPEED. My end goal was to get the site hosted on GitHub Pages, and then use Cloudflare to CDN it around the world.</p>
<p>(WP2Static does actually have a system to deploy to GitHub Pages built-in, but I found the deployment process just too slow.)</p>
<p>So when I considered everything I was trying to achieve, which included keeping the live site on the same URL it was already on, I opted to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>move the WordPress install of my site off its current server, onto my localhost machine (it’s fast and I back it up regularly)</li>
<li>use WP2Static to output the site to a local folder</li>
<li>use git via the terminal to publish the site</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, for a nerd, it seems fairly straightforward. And on the whole it worked much more easily than I anticipated. The main glitches to overcome were that a number of font files weren’t being picked up by the plugin for inclusion in the static site. But it has a configuration option to force it to include certain file paths, so that was easily overcome.</p>
<p>I did need to create a manual 404.html page (GitHub Pages looks for that in the top directory of a site) but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>There were a few other tiny things that were really specific to my own WordPress setup – like realising my sitemap.xml file needed to be a flat XML file rather than an index linking to other XML files – because they weren’t going to be wrapped up by the plugin.</p>
<p>The thing you really lose with any static site system though is (logically) user interaction. In my case that was just forms, but I was happy to replace my contact form with a simple email address – anything else I might need in the future I can do by embedding forms directly from another system like Google Forms.</p>
<p>I used to sell a couple of SEO packages directly through my site, but Woocommerce was always overkill for that anyway. In the future I’ll just use a combination of Paypal buttons to replicate the same functionality – and in fact it’ll be simpler for the end user because I don’t need to know all their billing address information to start an SEO job with them.</p>
<p>The really big day-to-day drawback is that clicking ‘Publish’ in WordPress doesn’t publish anything anymore. The process to run a new export with WP2Static and then send it to GitHub Pages takes about two minutes. But considering how often I blog or change anything on the site that’s not a major issue. Like with anything, you need to weigh up the processes, pros and cons against how you actually use something to determine if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>The site I did all this too, fyi, is the one you’re on right now. This is a static site, hosted for free on GitHub Pages and replicated on servers around the world using Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Google PageSpeed Insights gives a 99% speed rating for Desktop. And the missing 1% is simply because I include an external file that I can’t set an expiration header for – ironically that file is the script for Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Pingdom (my preferred speed testing system, because you can choose a server location for the real-world load-time to be tested against – so if your clients are predominantly in London then choose that server to get an idea of the speed as they’ll see it) gives the homepage a 0.212 second loading time. For something ultimately based on WordPress as a content management system, that’s impressive.</p>

<h2>The correct approach to image tags may surprise you.</h2>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a reminder about why they are best optimised using a plugin.</strong></p>
<p>Because of the way WordPress evolved over time from a simple blogging tool to an advanced content management system, traditionally people have set alt &amp; title tags per image, using the media manager.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not best for SEO. Images should reinforce what the <strong>page</strong> is about, not <em>just</em> what the image is of.</p>
<p>To give an example, if you have one image that&#8217;s used on two pages, you might not want them to both have the same alt tags. So the systems I set up does an excellent job of setting those tags in the live code whenever a page is visited. It mixes the page title with the name of your site to make sure both your branding and (most importantly) what the page is actually about is being reinforced.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best approach for image tags and search engines.</p>
<p>(My favourite plugin for this is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pb-seo-friendly-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PB SEO Friendly Images.)</a></p>

<h2>Far too many WordPress sites end up with empty social links</h2>
<p><strong>I see this all the time; in the header or footer of WordPress sites, a series of little social media icons that links to &#8211; nothing.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of WordPress themes have sections for you to fill out your social profiles, so those little buttons can link to them correctly. But a lot of those themes will show them regardless of whether or not you&#8217;ve entered proper URLs. Some go a step further, and by default will have a link entered as <em>#.</em> That just means it links back to the page you&#8217;re on, but it&#8217;s enough to get the buttons showing and essentially linking to nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy enough oversight to make. But it means you have dead links which isn&#8217;t great for your SEO, and if visitors notice then it just seems wildly unprofessional.</p>
<p>If you have social buttons, they really need to link to social sites. It&#8217;s not hard to do &#8211; these sorts of WordPress themes are intended to make everything as simple as possible &#8211; but at the very least have a quick check of your own site and make sure your social button links, well, <em>link.</em></p>
<p>In all honesty I see this in perhaps a third of WordPress sites overall, so there&#8217;s a good chance it affects your&#8217;s.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

You&#8217;ve made your WordPress site, launched it, then noticed all the empty comment sections and wondered where they came from.</p>
<p>Commenting in WordPress is turned on by default.</p>
<p>To switch it off, got to:<br />
Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Discussion</p>
<p>and untick:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles</li>
<li>Allow people to post comments on new articles</li>
</ul>
<p>That sorts out all your future posts and pages. But what about the ones you&#8217;ve already published?</p>
<p>For all current posts you have to do each manually. The easiest way is to go to:<br />
Dashboard &gt; Poststhen click &#8220;Quick Edit&#8221; under them one by one, and unticking these options:<br />

<p>Being sure to &#8220;Update&#8221; after each one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a faff, especially if you&#8217;ve already published a lot of content. But a learning experience nonetheless.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1471" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/noindex-wordpress-seo-440x150.png" alt="noindex wordpress seo" width="440" height="150" />&#8220;noindex&#8221; is a simple setting you can activate for any page on your site that instructs search engines not to scan it.</p>
<p>Using WordPress you&#8217;ll usually find this on each page and post in the Dashboard, in the settings for whichever SEO Plugin you use (All In One SEO pack, Yoast, etc.).</p>
<p>Most other content management systems will have their own setting, or if your site is totally bespoke you can add this to the code in the &lt;head&gt; section:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;meta name=&#8221;robots&#8221; content=&#8221;noindex,follow&#8221; /&gt;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why would you want search engines to ignore a page when they come to index your site?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons actually, but the most common is duplicate content. If you have two pages on your site that have similar content, you want to mark one as noindex so it doesn&#8217;t appear as though you&#8217;ve stuffed your site with multiple copies of the same thing.</p>
<p>Google and the other major engines see duplicate content as an attempt to make your site look fuller than it really is, or to have stolen content from elsewhere to try to fill your site up quickly, without much thought, and very little originality.</p>
<p>The other time to definitely use nofollow is if you have used a significant portion of content from another site. Sometimes there is a legitimate reason to grab content from elsewhere and publish it yourself, but you should always stop it from being indexed.</p>
<p>Now, before you get too excited and think &#8220;I&#8217;m fine, I&#8217;ve not got anything on my site that exists elsewhere at all&#8221;, let me ask you about your Terms and Conditions. Did you have those written from scratch? Or are they standardised, lifted from another site, or based on a template?</p>
<p>noindex them. Even though they&#8217;re just the legal bits, you don&#8217;t want Google to have any reason to think your site has a predilection toward duplicate content.</p>

There&#8217;s a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there.</p>
<p>When search engines first came out (pre-Google), the idea that they could read a whole website was out of reach. It would take too long, require they store too much data, and generally there needed to be a quick, simple approach to scanning a website. The simplest of the simplest techniques was &#8220;meta keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>This was a small piece of code that lived behind the scenes of a site, that listed all the keywords a site owner wanted their site to rank with. The list was delineated by a comma, so looked something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;meta name=&#8221;keywords&#8221; content=&#8221;SEO, search engine optimisation, WordPress&#8221; /&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>This method was open to huge amounts of abuse on the part of a website owner. There was nothing stopping someone using keywords which were known to rank well, but didn&#8217;t even appear in their website. We started seeing tens of thousands of search results which were really a bait and switch, and it was eroding from the quality of the internet.</p>
<p>Google came along, and was one of the first search engines to really have a strong ethos behind it, in that they wanted to find a way to keep the internet useful, and digitally clean &amp; tidy.</p>
<p>The solution was to index every site&#8217;s entire contents, scanning all the text that a real human could actually read, and working out based on sentence structure, density of nouns etc what a website was really about.</p>
<p>The next step was to start overlooking the meta keyword tag entirely.</p>
<p>And that was about a decade ago. Other major search engines followed suit, and as a result that list of keywords has been defunct and totally ignored for the best part of a decade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for a host of reasons (many SEO &#8220;experts&#8221; don&#8217;t actually keep ahead of best practice, or are too happy to just do whatever their clients ask without explaining the process, or just that keyword lists entered the collectively consciousness at a formative time in the internet&#8217;s history) people still think they&#8217;re going to be useful.</p>
<p>One of the most popular SEO plugins for WordPress actually says next to the &#8220;Use keywords?&#8221; field, &#8220;I can&#8217;t think why you&#8217;d want to know. The search engines don&#8217;t&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sadly a lot of people get caught up on these, and their focus disappears from what is important to something that absolutely is not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not helped by the number of places that lists of words and phrases ARE still used, like Google Adsense for example. We also track our website&#8217;s analytics based on what search queries people found us with, etc.</p>
<p>I prefer to call these things &#8220;search terms&#8221;, or occasionally &#8220;key terms&#8221;. I try to steer clear of the (possible) synonym &#8220;keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what I do in this regard is to look at your site as Google et al try to, (pretty well) as a human being. I read your site to see what it&#8217;s really about. I then run tests just like they do to see what words and phrases you use most often, and check that those do a good job of describing what your site is actually about. Most of the time, as long as someone has written their website from their own knowledge and experience of their industry or topic, these match just fine.</p>
<p>Occasionally I find someone thinks they have a site about, say, &#8220;window fitting&#8221;, but really it comes across as being about &#8220;buy my product&#8221;. You can imagine how that might happen, but it&#8217;s not want the search companies want to see so it&#8217;s not what we want to give them.</p>
<p>If I come across a discrepancy like that, I let my clients know that they need to rethink their content asap.</p>
<p>As long as they do match, I make sure I reinforce those terms everywhere we know Google et al want to see them. In image tags, in the description tag, in the page titles.</p>
<p>So, the short answer to a long history is let me take care of that&#8211;if I need to alert you to an issue I&#8217;ll let you know, and please don&#8217;t be surprised if you look at your site&#8217;s code when I&#8217;ve done and there is no outdated &#8220;keywords&#8221; code.</p>
