<p>He had an online brand that was working pretty well, but then another site that in practice was unrelated, and a desire for a third to help attract different clients, but for a similar product offering.</p>
<p>Step one was to get the existing site working for him, ready to integrate with his personal brand. And that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at, so after quite some years without any change or improvement, <a href="http://shyclinic.com" target="_blank">The Shyness Clinic</a> is finally ready to fly.</p>

Reinforcing your messages, your values, who you are and what you do.</p>
<p>Each page, every blog post, should help strengthen those key messages.</p>
<p>When we stop thinking about SEO in terms of its technical aspects, and instead see it as a form of communicating and interacting, it becomes both easier to understand, and perhaps more importantly we can start to slot it in with the rest of our business plans.</p>
<p>Almost everything we do in every aspect of our lives (including work!) is about the interplay between people. If we can find a way to see more of the processes we invest our energy and time in in those terms, then a cohesive model starts to emerge.</p>

<p>I spent much of last year involved in making personal brands for people to improve their search engine rankings, industry positioning, and overall getting them in more clients and more revenue.</p>
<p>On the back of my 17 years web development/design experience, my decade long history of helping people with their social networking, and months of testing and improving my system, I&#8217;ve created a personal branding product that will do wonders for you, your reputation, and of course your income.</p>
<p>Currently it&#8217;s only being offered through People Per Hour (PPH), but watch this space&#8211;when I&#8217;ve got a few more of these under my belt you can expect this package to cost over £700.</p>
<p>Right now it&#8217;s just £167!</p>

<p>Ultimately the webcraft.co team will consist of several people, so it doesn&#8217;t seem right to have it so much based around myself.</p>
<p>But conversely, because people were interacting so much with me via peterwm.local, I found myself preparing products to sell here, rather than just my time.</p>
<p>It was all getting a bit mixed up.</p>
<p>Over the next few days I&#8217;ll be doing a complete overhaul of <a href="http://webcraft.co" target="_blank">webcraft.co</a> to make it less about me as a person, and focus more on the products we sell. Online branding, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), Online community, etc. And this site, my personal brand, will be much more focused on me, my skills, my experience, my story, and of course, how to hire me for bespoke work.</p>
<p>Naturally the two sites will interact (in a very specific way) but all in all this is the culmination over my strategising and thinking for some time now.</p>
<p>A number of people have been asking for a solution to just this conundrum—&#8221;when you are your business, but also yourself, how do you best separate while integrating those two identities?&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to show you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>7 days ago, I didn&#8217;t rank on Google. I had a look for myself, and gave up on page 12. Anyone else would have given up long before, or at least found a Peter Mahoney they liked the look of more. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>3 days ago, I was at the top of page 3.</p>
<p><strong>Today, I am fourth overall,</strong> and the first result for an actual person. This applies to a search for <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=peter+mahoney" target="_blank">Peter Mahoney in google.co.uk</a> (I&#8217;m aiming myself at the UK market).</p>
<p>The top two results are for Linkedin directories, which both feature me in the number two spot, and a phone directory listing.</p>
<p>Peter Mahoney isn&#8217;t exactly an unusual name either. The marketing director of Nuance is a fairly well known and written about Peter Mahoney. A Peter Mahoney (regrettably) committed suicide after returning from fighting in Iraq, and a Peter Mahoney in Somerset appeared in court in connection with a murder enquiry. petermahoney.com has been owned for over a decade by the same person. None of these are me.</p>
<p>But in seven-short days, I have gone from not featuring at all, to beating out even Facebook results. It&#8217;s the result of a lot of experimentation, research, and 16 years web experience.</p>
<p>I plan to bottle this. And to make it available to you.</p>
