<p>A Google UK search for &#8220;Peter Mahoney&#8221; returns my website as the top result.</p>
<p>Hitting number one is pretty phenomenal, especially when you consider that in the tech world there are a couple of CEO&#8217;s of major international companies sharing my name.</p>
<p>Plus this means when people ask me for my URL, I can show off my SEO skills by simply saying, &#8220;Google me&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? I want to see my Twitter feed at number two, that&#8217;s what.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-550" title="libre_office_open_office" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/libre_office_open_office-150x150.png" alt="Libre Office, Open Office" width="150" height="150" />There&#8217;s a reason people abbreviate Microsoft to M$—it&#8217;s incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>But it gets bought out of habit, because it&#8217;s something most computer users have been using for over a decade, and surely the most popular product must be the best, right?</p>
<p>Something that has long annoyed me about the computer industry is the way the stack the deck when it comes to needing the newest thing.</p>
<p>Case in point: the latest version of Office comes out. You head down to the store to buy it, because they have this new fancy &#8220;x&#8221; on the end of the file extensions and you want to make sure your files will play nicely with most other people.</p>
<p>Whoops, your old operating system won&#8217;t work with it. And your computer is too old to run the newest version of Windows, so why not just buy a new computer?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got more processing power than the average simian brain, produces more colours than were previously known to science, and runs faster than a cheetah on heat*.</p>
<p>Or just put this process in reverse—a new computer, with a new OS, needs a new version of Office.</p>
<p>And why can your old computer NOT run something as simple as a word processing program? Simple: they <em>bloat</em> it.</p>
<p>They stick in fancier looking buttons, more help files, extra layers of stuff you&#8217;ll never even know about, and the only reason for doing so is to sell you a newer version of their product.</p>
<p>But if they didn’t, the old system would probably last you for years doing just what you need; Internet access, word processing, and email.</p>
<p>Enter OpenOffice (and it&#8217;s fork, LibreOffice). It&#8217;s an Office suite with everything you need; word processing, spreadsheets, presentations—and it&#8217;s<em> free. </em>It&#8217;s maintained by a community of skilled volunteers who are dedicated to seeing computing be an open experience, not one based on finance and money making for a few huge companies.</p>
<p>Best of all, it&#8217;s files are compatible with Office anyway. And it will open Office files, so you don&#8217;t need to recreate anything you already have. It doesn&#8217;t need massive amounts of processing power because it&#8217;s built to perform a function, rather than sell units.</p>
<p>Increasingly my client&#8217;s of mine are sending me files that have been made using OpenOffice, so the uptake is good.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;ve not tried it out already, I highly recommend you do. It&#8217;s an example of what online communities can achieve. It&#8217;s also very, very <strong>awesome.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank">OpenOffice.org</a></p>
<p>* I have no idea if Cheetah&#8217;s run faster when on heat. Or indeed, if they do experience &#8220;heat&#8221; like domestic cats. Feel free to let me know!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I listen to a LOT of music. It&#8217;s not often you&#8217;ll see me without a pair of headphones on (which might have something to do with why I&#8217;ve got a hearing test this afternoon!).</p>
<p>Some of it is undeniably wonderful, and some of my tastes&#8230;well&#8230;let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s not often that I give out my last.fm profile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also big on sharing, and like to share playlists or tracks with friends on Facebook, but found whenever I did they were coming up with the &#8220;only me&#8221; privacy setting, which is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.</p>
<p>With Facebook&#8217;s seemingly fortnightly changes to it&#8217;s privacy management, it&#8217;s not always obvious where you fix something like that.</p>
<p>Here is exactly how you fix <em>precisely</em> that:</p>
