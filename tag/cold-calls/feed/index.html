<p>Heck, I get these calls regularly myself. I enjoy challenging the people on the other end of the line, and very quickly one thing becomes clear.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve no idea what they&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>SEO, sadly, isn&#8217;t a regulated industry, and because of the level of investment people put into their online presences it&#8217;s very easy to frighten them with bogus information.</p>
<p>The people emailing and calling are sales people; often for firms that with a bit of digging, you can find myriad horror stories about online.</p>
<p>My favourite examples of their spiel include, &#8220;Your site doesn&#8217;t have keyword tags&#8221; (search engines <a title="Does Google use meta keyword tags?" href="https://peterwm.com/does-google-use-meta-keyword-tags/">don&#8217;t actually use them</a>) and &#8220;Your site isn&#8217;t W3 compliant&#8221; (Google has made it clear this has no effect on a site&#8217;s ranking).</p>
<p>The latter is particularly nefarious, because although a W3 compliant site is certainly best practice&#8211;very few sites do tick all the boxes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s scaremongering at its worst.</p>
<p>Remember, when you get a call out of the blue, or emails that by rights should go straight to your spam folder, always check with a known professional, someone you trust. And if you are considering working with a new company, ask how many sales people they have compared to actual SEO experts on staff.</p>
<p>Do some checking, to make sure what they&#8217;re telling you is true.</p>
