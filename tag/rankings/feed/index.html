								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>7 days ago, I didn&#8217;t rank on Google. I had a look for myself, and gave up on page 12. Anyone else would have given up long before, or at least found a Peter Mahoney they liked the look of more. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>3 days ago, I was at the top of page 3.</p>
<p><strong>Today, I am fourth overall,</strong> and the first result for an actual person. This applies to a search for <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=peter+mahoney" target="_blank">Peter Mahoney in google.co.uk</a> (I&#8217;m aiming myself at the UK market).</p>
<p>The top two results are for Linkedin directories, which both feature me in the number two spot, and a phone directory listing.</p>
<p>Peter Mahoney isn&#8217;t exactly an unusual name either. The marketing director of Nuance is a fairly well known and written about Peter Mahoney. A Peter Mahoney (regrettably) committed suicide after returning from fighting in Iraq, and a Peter Mahoney in Somerset appeared in court in connection with a murder enquiry. petermahoney.com has been owned for over a decade by the same person. None of these are me.</p>
<p>But in seven-short days, I have gone from not featuring at all, to beating out even Facebook results. It&#8217;s the result of a lot of experimentation, research, and 16 years web experience.</p>
<p>I plan to bottle this. And to make it available to you.</p>
