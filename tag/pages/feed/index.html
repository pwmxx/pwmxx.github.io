In some ways I feel a bit silly doing it because it&#8217;s just so cheap, but meeting new people makes pretty much everything worth while in my book!</p>
<p>Your Facebook Page needs to carry a LOT of important messages about you in just a couple of graphics. Too many people just shove their corporate logo up as their Page&#8217;s profile pic, and some large photo they like as the cover image. And certainly sometimes that can be the best option, but in most cases, it&#8217;s a wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>Who are you? Who is your target market? What sort of ethos do you and your business wnat to foster?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t tell people who you are you leave them free reign to form their own ideas about you and your business.</p>
<p>Seriously take a look at your Facebook Page right now. What does it show, at-a-glance, about you and your company?</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t say as much as it could, <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com/hourlie/design-your-facebook-page-for-you/33448" target="_blank">hire me for the ridiculously low sum of £19 to sort it out for you.</a></p>

<p>Do bear in mind though, even though your Facebook Page&#8217;s profile picture needs to be 180 pixels square, Facebook actually automatically crops out 10 pixels on all four sides. So basically, create an image that&#8217;s 180px, but know that you&#8217;ll lose a bit around the edges.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also have me do this for you, I make a lot of these for people! In fact, I&#8217;ve done over 100 in the past 12 months.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m always amazed how often I see the words &#8220;If you&#8217;re not already using LinkedIn&#8221;&#8230;there is no excuse not to be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an essential.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you haven’t already included LinkedIn in your company’s online social media efforts, then you should certainly consider adding a LinkedIn company page to your web presence arsenal. LinkedIn is considered one of the most influential social media platforms on the web, and can make a huge difference in terms of your business’ social media marketing strategy.</p>
<p>A LinkedIn page can connect you with a really wide net of potential partners, customers, suppliers and helpful contacts, and requires a lot less regular attention than many of your other social media accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>via <a href="http://www.famousbloggers.net/company-linkedin-page.html" target="_blank">5 Tips for Creating Your Company Linkedin Page</a>.</p>
<p>Honestly, there are so many good reasons to be using it. I accept that if you&#8217;re used to the concepts of social networking that you&#8217;ll pick up using Facebook or Twitter it can seem a bit odd, but it&#8217;s networking, it&#8217;s social, and has a built in professional audience looking to make money.</p>
