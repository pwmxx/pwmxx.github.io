<p>I spent much of last year involved in making personal brands for people to improve their search engine rankings, industry positioning, and overall getting them in more clients and more revenue.</p>
<p>On the back of my 17 years web development/design experience, my decade long history of helping people with their social networking, and months of testing and improving my system, I&#8217;ve created a personal branding product that will do wonders for you, your reputation, and of course your income.</p>
<p>Currently it&#8217;s only being offered through People Per Hour (PPH), but watch this space&#8211;when I&#8217;ve got a few more of these under my belt you can expect this package to cost over £700.</p>
<p>Right now it&#8217;s just £167!</p>

<p>Ultimately the webcraft.co team will consist of several people, so it doesn&#8217;t seem right to have it so much based around myself.</p>
<p>But conversely, because people were interacting so much with me via peterwm.local, I found myself preparing products to sell here, rather than just my time.</p>
<p>It was all getting a bit mixed up.</p>
<p>Over the next few days I&#8217;ll be doing a complete overhaul of <a href="http://webcraft.co" target="_blank">webcraft.co</a> to make it less about me as a person, and focus more on the products we sell. Online branding, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), Online community, etc. And this site, my personal brand, will be much more focused on me, my skills, my experience, my story, and of course, how to hire me for bespoke work.</p>
<p>Naturally the two sites will interact (in a very specific way) but all in all this is the culmination over my strategising and thinking for some time now.</p>
<p>A number of people have been asking for a solution to just this conundrum—&#8221;when you are your business, but also yourself, how do you best separate while integrating those two identities?&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to show you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s certainly one of them!</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s visual identity is so strong, they can mess with it all they want and we still recognise it.</p>
<p>Their regular <a href="http://www.google.com/doodles/finder/2012/All%20doodles" target="_blank">Google Doodles</a> (used to commemorate or celebrate people and events, or just for <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man" target="_blank">a fun game of Pacman</a>) has changed our perception of their visual branding. We don&#8217;t even need to see the letters that spell the company name for us to identify them.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s was a great example of that for me. Over time their Doodle&#8217;s have become more adventurous, and here we are on the 125th birthday of artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Lowry" target="_blank">T. S. Lowry</a> with one of the boldest yet.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-158"  title="The strongest visual brand in the world? Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ts_lowry_google_doodle.png"  alt="The strongest visual brand in the world? Peter Mahoney"  width="419" height="162" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ts_lowry_google_doodle.png 419w, https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ts_lowry_google_doodle-300x115.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /></p>
<p>It ties into their primary visual identity through colour, position of objects, and vaguely the shape of the buildings too. And that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Yet I know this is Google. I can see it. In fact, when I&#8217;m shown one of these Doodles I actively look and seek out how their logo fits in. I <em>want</em> to see their visual brand in these images.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s branding.</p>
