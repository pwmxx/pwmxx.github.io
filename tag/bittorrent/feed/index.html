								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As controversial as they may be, I have to hand it to The Pirate Bay, they certainly keep themselves at the forefront of technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our data flows around in thousands of clouds, in deeply encrypted forms, ready to be used when necessary. Earth bound nodes that transform the data are as deeply encrypted and reboot into a deadlock if not used for 8 hours.</p>
<p>All attempts to attack The Pirate Bay from now on is an attack on everything and nothing. The site that you&#8217;re at will still be here, for as long as we want it to. Only in a higher form of being. A reality to us. A ghost to those who wish to harm us.</p></blockquote>
<p>via <a href="https://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/224" target="_blank">The Pirate Bay &#8211; The galaxy&#8217;s most resilient bittorrent site</a>.</p>
<p>It used to be said that the pornography industry drove innovation, but I would say for the past few years it&#8217;s been the file sharers.</p>
<p>The Pirate bay have looked into hosting their sites on a series of flying drones, that operate over international waters. It sounds incredible (in the, &#8220;that must be made up, it&#8217;s too <em>incredible</em>&#8221; sense of the word), but it&#8217;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/pirate-bay-plans-to-build-aerial-server-drones-with-35-linux-computer/" target="_blank">quite achievable.</a> In fact, they wouldn&#8217;t even be <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/worlds-first-flying-file-sharing-drones-in-action-120320/" target="_blank">the first to do it.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve longed imagined a distributed form of web server, which is a step beyond even what they&#8217;re doing here&#8211;where the web server software doesn&#8217;t even live on one computer, but is shared around the world.</p>
<p>On the one hand that seems inconceivable to most people right now. And while what they&#8217;re doing may be questionable at best, I choose to keep thinking the undo-able can be done, I think with the flying drones, and the metaphors for deity.</p>
<p>If we stop dreaming, we stop creating.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make stuff instead.</p>
