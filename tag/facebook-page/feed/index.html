In some ways I feel a bit silly doing it because it&#8217;s just so cheap, but meeting new people makes pretty much everything worth while in my book!</p>
<p>Your Facebook Page needs to carry a LOT of important messages about you in just a couple of graphics. Too many people just shove their corporate logo up as their Page&#8217;s profile pic, and some large photo they like as the cover image. And certainly sometimes that can be the best option, but in most cases, it&#8217;s a wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>Who are you? Who is your target market? What sort of ethos do you and your business wnat to foster?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t tell people who you are you leave them free reign to form their own ideas about you and your business.</p>
<p>Seriously take a look at your Facebook Page right now. What does it show, at-a-glance, about you and your company?</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t say as much as it could, <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com/hourlie/design-your-facebook-page-for-you/33448" target="_blank">hire me for the ridiculously low sum of Â£19 to sort it out for you.</a></p>

<p>Do bear in mind though, even though your Facebook Page&#8217;s profile picture needs to be 180 pixels square, Facebook actually automatically crops out 10 pixels on all four sides. So basically, create an image that&#8217;s 180px, but know that you&#8217;ll lose a bit around the edges.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also have me do this for you, I make a lot of these for people! In fact, I&#8217;ve done over 100 in the past 12 months.</p>
