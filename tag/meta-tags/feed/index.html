								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m often asked about how to change the description Google shows in their search results. (This post applies in part to many search engines, but Google in particular.)</p>
<p><img  title="Google descriptions Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1698" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/google-search-results-descriptions-440x99.png"  alt="Google descriptions Peter Mahoney"  width="440" height="99" />The answer is slightly more complicated than any of us might like. The old response (going back a decade or more) was to just change your meta description tag. Those used to be picked up verbatim.</p>
<p>But these days Google isn&#8217;t beholden to anything we provide (with the exception perhaps of your own domain name). They can pick and choose what they think will be most useful to their users. They don&#8217;t have to use the description we provide&#8211;they can choose to ignore it and create their own.</p>
<div>If we want to give our descriptions the best possible chance of being picked up, they need to conform to the following:</div>
<ul>
<li>be between 150-159 characters*</li>
<li>be in sentence structure</li>
<li>not include too many commas or ands &#8211; basically avoid things that make it look like it could be a list of keywords</li>
<li>ideally, it would be a whole sentence or two taken directly from the text of the page</li>
<li>in fact, really ideally it would be the first sentence or two from the page</li>
</ul>
<p>and on top of all that of course it needs to fit our own needs of being informative and enticing people to visit the site.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>* = Normally 130-160 (or some other variant within that range, but usually ending with 160) is touted as acceptable. Recent data suggests in fact 160 may be too long, many pages with 160 characters exactly are finding their descriptions are being truncated before the last word with a ellipses (&#8230;) added, making it look unfinished. So 159 seems the current practical maximum.</p>

Peter Mahoney"  src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/spammy-meta-keywords-tag-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/spammy-meta-keywords-tag-150x150.jpg 150w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/spammy-meta-keywords-tag-90x90.jpg 90w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Here&#8217;s a brief history of keywords. There&#8217;s a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there.</p>
<p>When search engines first came out (pre-Google), the idea that they could read a whole website was out of reach. It would take too long, require they store too much data, and generally there needed to be a quick, simple approach to scanning a website. The simplest of the simplest techniques was &#8220;meta keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>This was a small piece of code that lived behind the scenes of a site, that listed all the keywords a site owner wanted their site to rank with. The list was delineated by a comma, so looked something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;meta name=&#8221;keywords&#8221; content=&#8221;SEO, search engine optimisation, WordPress&#8221; /&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>This method was open to huge amounts of abuse on the part of a website owner. There was nothing stopping someone using keywords which were known to rank well, but didn&#8217;t even appear in their website. We started seeing tens of thousands of search results which were really a bait and switch, and it was eroding from the quality of the internet.</p>
<p>Google came along, and was one of the first search engines to really have a strong ethos behind it, in that they wanted to find a way to keep the internet useful, and digitally clean &amp; tidy.</p>
<p>The solution was to index every site&#8217;s entire contents, scanning all the text that a real human could actually read, and working out based on sentence structure, density of nouns etc what a website was really about.</p>
<p>The next step was to start overlooking the meta keyword tag entirely.</p>
<p>And that was about a decade ago. Other major search engines followed suit, and as a result that list of keywords has been defunct and totally ignored for the best part of a decade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for a host of reasons (many SEO &#8220;experts&#8221; don&#8217;t actually keep ahead of best practice, or are too happy to just do whatever their clients ask without explaining the process, or just that keyword lists entered the collectively consciousness at a formative time in the internet&#8217;s history) people still think they&#8217;re going to be useful.</p>
<p>One of the most popular SEO plugins for WordPress actually says next to the &#8220;Use keywords?&#8221; field, &#8220;I can&#8217;t think why you&#8217;d want to know. The search engines don&#8217;t&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sadly a lot of people get caught up on these, and their focus disappears from what is important to something that absolutely is not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not helped by the number of places that lists of words and phrases ARE still used, like Google Adsense for example. We also track our website&#8217;s analytics based on what search queries people found us with, etc.</p>
<p>I prefer to call these things &#8220;search terms&#8221;, or occasionally &#8220;key terms&#8221;. I try to steer clear of the (possible) synonym &#8220;keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what I do in this regard is to look at your site as Google et al try to, (pretty well) as a human being. I read your site to see what it&#8217;s really about. I then run tests just like they do to see what words and phrases you use most often, and check that those do a good job of describing what your site is actually about. Most of the time, as long as someone has written their website from their own knowledge and experience of their industry or topic, these match just fine.</p>
<p>Occasionally I find someone thinks they have a site about, say, &#8220;window fitting&#8221;, but really it comes across as being about &#8220;buy my product&#8221;. You can imagine how that might happen, but it&#8217;s not want the search companies want to see so it&#8217;s not what we want to give them.</p>
<p>If I come across a discrepancy like that, I let my clients know that they need to rethink their content asap.</p>
<p>As long as they do match, I make sure I reinforce those terms everywhere we know Google et al want to see them. In image tags, in the description tag, in the page titles.</p>
<p>So, the short answer to a long history is let me take care of that&#8211;if I need to alert you to an issue I&#8217;ll let you know, and please don&#8217;t be surprised if you look at your site&#8217;s code when I&#8217;ve done and there is no outdated &#8220;keywords&#8221; code.</p>

You want your tribe to be well-positioned, and desirable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just just new members either, but existing ones want to know they&#8217;re a part of something exciting, something that ranks highly. Something prestigious.</p>
<p>The &#8220;meta tags&#8221; in your site&#8217;s code are really important here. There&#8217;s a science behind it of course, but it&#8217;s something you want an expert like myself to help you with. They&#8217;re small pieces of code that search engines read to get a better ides of what your site is about, and what keywords it should look for.</p>
<p>However, here&#8217;s one of the tricks of the trade you can use yourself. This tool gives you feedback and advice regarding your meta data, helpfully colour coded for people who don&#8217;t want to worry about interpreting too much of it.</p>
<p>My favourite metric it returns is to check how relevant your keywords are to your content. This is an absolute must, and something to look at for all your pages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit technical, but the colour coding helps.</p>
<p>Mind you, so can I.</p>
