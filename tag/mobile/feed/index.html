<p>Well they&#8217;ve really increased this as a search signal – sites that are NOT mobile friendly will now have a very hard time competing with those that are.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also updated <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">their mobile friendliness test</a> to make it more restrictive—it&#8217;s worth retesting your sites to make sure they still pass. Of course the best test is always the information displayed within Google Search Console which reports on the entire site, not just one page at a time.</p>
<p>The extra good news for those of you with mobile responsive sites is that any of your competitors who do not have mobile friendly sites will now suffer in their rankings.</p>
<p>One related point, there is a growing body of data that suggests this change also affects (in a smaller capacity) sites from normal desktops – that Google is prioritising sites that are mobile friendly on searches from ALL devices.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t confirmed that yet, so it&#8217;s not certain, but I am keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a responsive site for mobile devices yet and you don&#8217;t want to get caught out, <a href="http://pwmxx.github.io/contact/">please contact me</a> and I can help make you a new, fully mobile complaint one.</p>

<p>It makes their last major update well timed &#8211; just a couple of weeks ago they made sure mobile friendly sites would have priority in mobile-based search results over sites that are not.</p>
<p>But this does mean if your site isn&#8217;t mobile friendly, we have the stats to hand that show you ARE missing out of search engine potential. <a title="Contact" href="http://pwmxx.github.io/contact/">Contact me</a> and I can help.</p>

<p>Google has been sending out millions of these messages over the past couple of months.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google systems have tested 177 pages from your site and found that 32% of them have critical mobile usability errors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Google Webmaster Tools has long pointed out the important of having a mobile friendly site&#8211;but now Google is taking it seriously. When you&#8217;re looking at search results on a smart phone (which accounts for a huge percentage of people) you&#8217;ll see a little notification if a site is mobile friendly. Funnily enough, those sites will be getting most of the organic traffic.</p>
<p>There has never been a better time to get a mobile friendly, responsive website.</p>
<p>All the sites I build are responsive, and you&#8217;re welcome to <a title="Contact" href="http://pwmxx.github.io/contact/">ask for my help.</a></p>
