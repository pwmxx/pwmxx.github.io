								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A lot of SEO professionals are still selling their services based on a very outdated idea of how SEO works.</h2>
<p><strong>Anyone telling you they target a set number of keywords really isn&#8217;t doing SEO right.</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, an important terminology definition. The term <em>keywords</em> has meant a few different things over the past 20+ years in the Search Engine Optimisation industry. As such I prefer not to use it and try to use other words that do a better job of explaining what I mean. So when it comes to describing the concept of &#8216;phrases you want to rank highly with in search results&#8217; I use the term <em>search queries.</em> That does a much better job of conveying what we mean &#8211; the words people search for that your website gets found for.</p>
<p>Years ago SEO services would be sold based around (in part) a concept of how many search queries your site would be optimised for. But search doesn&#8217;t work like that anymore (and hasn&#8217;t for a number of years). It&#8217;s not as simple as having a list of a few terms we target &#8211; since Google brought their Rankbrain (artificial intelligence system) online for website indexing, everything is far more nuanced.</p>
<p>Technically a site can rank and be found for ANY of the words and terms on it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about a few of these issues before, so these articles might help give useful background:<br />
<a href="https://peterwm.com/googles-rankbrain-and-seo/">https://peterwm.com/googles-rankbrain-and-seo/</a><br />
<a href="https://peterwm.com/does-google-use-meta-keyword-tags/">https://peterwm.com/does-google-use-meta-keyword-tags/</a></p>
<p>SEO work is all about reinforcing your key content so it stand out for search engines. But anything within the content can (and often is) indexed by them. As an example if you ever get a chance to see the Google Search Console performance report you&#8217;ll often see hundreds of things a site is found for.</p>
<p>For example my site is clearly about being a WordPress SEO expert, and services around that. But in search results it comes up for over 1000 different searches, and a lot of those aren&#8217;t related to my core offerings. But they&#8217;re all related to words, brands or nouns I&#8217;ve used in the past. Googles does a great job of working out the context of your site, but with good SEO you can be found for just about anything.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>7 days ago, I didn&#8217;t rank on Google. I had a look for myself, and gave up on page 12. Anyone else would have given up long before, or at least found a Peter Mahoney they liked the look of more. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>3 days ago, I was at the top of page 3.</p>
<p><strong>Today, I am fourth overall,</strong> and the first result for an actual person. This applies to a search for <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=peter+mahoney" target="_blank">Peter Mahoney in google.co.uk</a> (I&#8217;m aiming myself at the UK market).</p>
<p>The top two results are for Linkedin directories, which both feature me in the number two spot, and a phone directory listing.</p>
<p>Peter Mahoney isn&#8217;t exactly an unusual name either. The marketing director of Nuance is a fairly well known and written about Peter Mahoney. A Peter Mahoney (regrettably) committed suicide after returning from fighting in Iraq, and a Peter Mahoney in Somerset appeared in court in connection with a murder enquiry. petermahoney.com has been owned for over a decade by the same person. None of these are me.</p>
<p>But in seven-short days, I have gone from not featuring at all, to beating out even Facebook results. It&#8217;s the result of a lot of experimentation, research, and 16 years web experience.</p>
<p>I plan to bottle this. And to make it available to you.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t search terribly far into the search engines, so unless you&#8217;re in the top 10 of Google or Bing, or the top 50 of Yahoo!, you won&#8217;t get a result. And clearly you need me to help you out. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Open it in a text editor, find and replace in there, then re-upload to phpMyAdmin.</p>
<p>In short, I get it done easily in a bout 45 seconds without having to worry about a typo in an SQL query destroying my data.</p>
