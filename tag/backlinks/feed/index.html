<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote a post about backlinks. But it&#8217;s always worth re-iterating this.</p>
<p>In short, my stance on these has only become stronger, because Google has become even more clever.</p>
<p>The shortest answer to the backlink question is that having backlinks is very beneficial.</p>
<p>But the longer answer is actually more important. Google has become incredibly adept at working out which backlinks are natural (i.e., someone liked your site and linked to it) as opposed to bought, meaning you paid for them.</p>
<p>Natural backlinks help your SEO, generally speaking. As for manipulated ones, once Google realises what you&#8217;ve done (which can take a few months) they will usually hurt your rank, often quite drastically.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people selling what they called &#8220;safe&#8221; links, or &#8220;Google friendly links&#8221;. In truth Google is very clear that any attempt to buy or create links is contrary to their ethos and something they will try to find and penalise you for.</p>
<p>And they are very good at it.</p>
<p>The reason people still sell them is a quirk of Google&#8217;s algorithm. When Google first see new links come in for a site they will <em>almost</em> always improve that sites ranking. It&#8217;s not until they&#8217;ve seen the patterns emerge and they realise they were faked links that they penalise you.</p>
<p>So when someone first buys links they usually do see an improvement, and feel happy with the service that made them. Months later when their site takes a hit&mdash;it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>So, are backlinks good? Absolutely. Should you try to have them created on your behalf? Absolutely not.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img  title="External links to and from your site Peter Mahoney" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1675" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/seo-external-links-metaphor-440x150.jpg"  alt="External links to and from your site Peter Mahoney"  width="440" height="150" /></p>
<h2>A leaking glass more than half-full</h2>
<p>Links pointing in to your site are really important for SEO. Google has started suggesting they may be less and less important, and give it 5-7 years I think they&#8217;ll be one of the lesser important SEO criteria (in favour of RankBrain and Artificial Intelligence tools that can really determine how quality the site and it&#8217;s contents are.). But for now, external links from other sites are still important.</p>
<p>But, well, let&#8217;s think of links in and out like a glass of water being filled up and poured out.</p>
<ul>
<li>For each link pointing to your site, lets fill up the glass a little. As it gets fuller it gets more SEO authority, which is great.</li>
<li>But for each link out, we can empty the glass a bit too.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if for every link you have <em>in</em> you also have one <em>out,</em> the glass actually ends up empty*.</p>
<p>People used to make sites called &#8220;link traps&#8221; that didn&#8217;t link externally to anything, trying to full their glass right up. But as you&#8217;d expect Google got wise to this technique, and started to penalise sites if they did this—it&#8217;s contrary to the idea of a well-formed world wide web, and Google wants to help steer the web to be as useful as possible.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s important to have some links out. I usually recommend a ratio of 4/1 &#8211; for every four links in, have one link out. That does vary based on a couple of factors, but it&#8217;s a good rule of thumb.</p>
<p>The glass fills faster than it empties, so Google is happy, and we are too.</p>
<p>* &#8211; important note, this is a very simplistic metaphor. Not all links are created equal, so if you have a link to your site from the BBC homepage, and a link out to your friend&#8217;s Etsy shop, you&#8217;d still end up with more water in the glass because in that case the link in has more SEO authority than the page you&#8217;re linking to. But because most sites aren&#8217;t in that position (most sites will have links in and out from sites swimming with them in a similar depth in the pool of link-juice; but I&#8217;ve used enough liquid-based similes for one day), it&#8217;s still a useful analogy.</p>

<p><strong>LIES.</strong></p>
<p>I know I bang on about the trouble with buying backlinks. Regular readers will be familiar with my disdain for people selling the impossible—since Google&#8217;s Panda algorithm tries very hard to find people buying links, saying any scheme like this is &#8220;Panda safe&#8221; or even worse, &#8220;Panda friendly&#8221; is just a plain old lie.</p>
<p>So, at the risk of repeating myself, I&#8217;m going to say some things I&#8217;ve said before, albeit in a more concise and succinct form.</p>
<p>It is true that Google does like to see links to your site. But they are excellent at discerning real links (where someone liked your site or service enough to link to it) from purchased ones.</p>
<p>I generally stand against buying backlinks, because of my &#8220;SEO ethos&#8221;. My ethos is simple by the way—Google have given us a swag of information regarding what search engines do and do not want—so I say we give them what they&#8217;re after. And avoid what they&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>Plus, I have about three jobs a week come in from people who bought back links and got caught—and dropped off Google completely. When they penalise you, they <strong>really</strong> hit you hard.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, really awesome backlinks would certainly help your SEO. But 99% of the time buying them is not awesome, and therefore I recommend avoiding it.</p>
<p>I, like Google, see SEO as a long game, if done properly. But also, if done properly, it &#8220;sticks&#8221;. A site with good SEO that&#8217;s risen to the top should stay at the top.</p>
<p>And with that, I shall get down from my well-trodden soap-box. That&#8217;s the end of my manifesto for the evening.</p>

<p>I talk a lot about the importance of doing SEO properly, and not trying to cheat the search engines.</p>
<p>Of all the tricks out there, the most tempting by far is buying backlinks.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google wants lots of sites to link to us, right? So let&#8217;s just get some and get moving up those rankings!</p></blockquote>
<p>Terrible, <em>terrible</em> idea.</p>
<p>A client of mine bought some from a seller claiming to be Google safe, Panda safe, Penguin safe, PR10, quality links.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t be Google-safe. All that will ever mean is they haven&#8217;t caught you (or the system being used to generate your links) yet. But they&#8217;ve been promising for a decade that they will, and more often than not, they do.</p>
<p>The image above is a bit small, but I&#8217;m sure you can pinpoint when they bought the so-called &#8220;safe&#8221; links.</p>
<p>Their sales fell proportionately.</p>

<p>Backlinks are useful, however I strongly recommend you do not buy any. If you get them &#8220;naturally&#8221; then that&#8217;s great. But Google has always said they will try to penalise any site that buys them. So while you might find a vendor who has some great system for implementing links that they haven&#8217;t found yet, if Google does realise that you&#8217;re trying to trick them (and they will eventually) you could find your site disappears from their listings entirely.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t do it. Fullstop.</p>

Links.</p>
<p>Back links, social links, white-hat links, black-hat links.</p>
<p>I called this post &#8220;Links &amp; <em>stuff</em>&#8221; because while the value of links is simple enough to understand, the jargon and terminology can make it seem more confusing than it is.</p>
<p>At its most simplistic—you really want as many links to your site as possible. You want them on blogs, local news sources, forums, social media, even from competitors sites (I&#8217;ve got a tip for that later on).</p>
<p>Because the more places on the Internet that link to you, the higher you get ranked in search engines. Google has always been very transparent about this, in fact the idea of indexing websites based on how many other places deem them useful enough to link to was their whole original idea. Which naturally has been replicated by other companies ad nauseum.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that&#8217;s it. But like everything with SEO, it&#8217;s the nuances that make a real difference.</p>
<p>A link to your online presence from a popular website dedicated to your industry is better than a little-read blog. Links from Facebook sit somewhere near the lower end of that scale, with Twitter slightly behind. It&#8217;s all worth having, but what you really want are high quality links on respected websites.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best way to get high quality links back to your site (backlinks, as they&#8217;re known) is to just ask for them. You&#8217;d be surprised how many professional blogs relish having guest bloggers—people who write once off entries for them, or perhaps even a short series of posts. It can take the stress of deadlines off them, or help them out when they can&#8217;t work owing to illness or preferably, a holiday. And of course they always link back to your site in the byline.</p>
<p>A quick way to generate backlinks that are from well known sites related to your field of expertise is to comment on posts that are already there. It&#8217;s quick and effective. In my case, I go to Google, search for &#8220;SEO&#8221;, and click on a recent high profile blog result. After quickly reading the article, I&#8217;ll post my thoughts in the comments, and link back to a related post on my own site. If I don&#8217;t have a related post, I make sure I do very quickly. It never hurts to have published my own ideas on a recent hot topic anyway.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the cheeky competitors site tip. Go to their site, and comment on <em>their</em> blogs. If possible, find an article there that relates to something you&#8217;ve already written about, and say so. &#8220;Interesting to see you finally catching up with this one, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for ages&#8221;. Cheeky. But include a link to your post, and not only do you get the SEO benefits, but you can hijack part of their readership.</p>
<p>Make sure you have Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin profiles that can be publicly accessed, and link to your posts from there.</p>
<p>Make sure other people can share your posts socially easily too; sharing buttons beneath each post on your website can make a real difference.</p>
<p>I maintain a separate blog, <a href="http://peter.webcraft.co" target="_blank">peter.webcraft.co,</a> which has the sole purpose of containing links to my own work. But (importantly) it has other short content there too, after all if it was nothing but links to my own work Google would see right through me.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the whitehat/blackhat concepts. In computer jargon whitehat is most simply defined as &#8220;not doing anything dodgy&#8221;. Blackhat is the opposite.</p>
<p>There are all manner of techniques for building backlinks to up your search engine ratings. Anything you pay for is usually blackhat. Not illegal, but not exactly cricket either.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. Link pyramids. These used to be very popular, and at times quite costly. You&#8217;d pay someone to create an army of low-level links on social networks and lesser known blogs. Then those would link to more popular sites, but again these were all manufactured by the vendor. Then they&#8217;d point to a few really highly ranked site, and in turn they would point to your pages.</p>
<p>You were at the top of the pyramid, enjoying the view from the top of search engines rankings.</p>
<p>Then the search engines realised what was happening, and wrote highly intelligent algorithms to find these pyramids, and penalise them. A lot. I&#8217;m managing SEO for a client who had to move domain names just to get away from their previous ill-gotten reputation (earned before my involvement, I hasten to add). They had thousands of links, felt at the top of their game, then woke up one morning to find in the eyes of the world wide web, they barely existed anymore.</p>
<p>And then the link building industry moved to a link wheels, and again the cycle began, only to fall later.</p>
<p>And this is a very important lesson I can&#8217;t impart strongly enough. SEO is a long game, because it should be organic.</p>
<p>Yes, you can optimise your code, your site speed, your images, etc. Yes, you can spread the word by sharing links to your site on other related blogs, but that&#8217;s all real people doing real things. Have great content that people will want to engage with, and share.</p>
<p>But if you try to cheat the system, you&#8217;ll be slapped for it. And for many of us, with so much of our business conducted online, a slap can send us under.</p>
<p>Organic growth. Humans interacting. It&#8217;s what the Internet was supposed to be about. Search engines make unexpected guardians of that dream, but when it comes to being found online, they hold all the keys.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-650"  title="Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), a primer Peter Mahoney"   alt="Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), a primer Peter Mahoney"  src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/seo-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;m starting a series on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) to help explain a few key concepts, as well as helping guide you towards the right SEO expert. Ideally me of course, but whoever is telling you they&#8217;re an expert really should know how to cover more than the basics.</p>
<p>The number of people I see selling SEO services who really have no idea is appalling. (I&#8217;d say shocking, but there are a lot of opportunists out there!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to break my series of SEO posts into the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Site Speed</li>
<li>Social integration</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Back-links and all other things link oriented</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally there is a lot of cross-over between them, but over the course of the series you&#8217;ll get a better idea of some key concepts, and some fairly original (but proven) ideas for their implementation.</p>
<p>All of course to get you more quality visitors!</p>
