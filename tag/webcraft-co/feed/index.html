								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-123"  title="A new year, a new(ish) business model Peter Mahoney"  src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/twitter-150x150.png"  alt="A new year, a new(ish) business model Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/twitter-150x150.png 150w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/twitter.png 210w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />I spent much of last year trying to work out how myself as a freelance web designer and developer interacted with <a href="http://webcraft.co" target="_blank">webcraft.co,</a> my company.</p>
<p>Ultimately the webcraft.co team will consist of several people, so it doesn&#8217;t seem right to have it so much based around myself.</p>
<p>But conversely, because people were interacting so much with me via peterwm.local, I found myself preparing products to sell here, rather than just my time.</p>
<p>It was all getting a bit mixed up.</p>
<p>Over the next few days I&#8217;ll be doing a complete overhaul of <a href="http://webcraft.co" target="_blank">webcraft.co</a> to make it less about me as a person, and focus more on the products we sell. Online branding, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), Online community, etc. And this site, my personal brand, will be much more focused on me, my skills, my experience, my story, and of course, how to hire me for bespoke work.</p>
<p>Naturally the two sites will interact (in a very specific way) but all in all this is the culmination over my strategising and thinking for some time now.</p>
<p>A number of people have been asking for a solution to just this conundrum—&#8221;when you are your business, but also yourself, how do you best separate while integrating those two identities?&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to show you.</p>
