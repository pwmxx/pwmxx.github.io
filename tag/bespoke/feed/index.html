<p>Internally I&#8217;ve made a system that I interact with for my SEO work. Basically I work out the SEO strategy based on the research, then the system creates a file that I import to the site which acts as my starting point for the project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also really made communication more streamlined with a system I created that allows me to rapidly create customised template messages, and also store examples of messages that come up every now and then (but not very often) so I can refer to those the next time I need to send a similar message.</p>
<p>From a selling perspective I&#8217;m very keen to get some really strict packages I can sell to people. Strict in that we both know what&#8217;s involved and I don&#8217;t deviate from them. I all too often become the go to for my clients for bespoke changes even if they&#8217;re not paying for a regular maintenance package. I need to change that to make things easier on myself.</p><p>The post <a href="https://peterwm.com/im-working-hard-to-streamline-a-bunch-of/" target="_blank">I'm working hard to streamline a bunch of...</a> first appeared on <a href="https://peterwm.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress SEO Expert</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
