<h2>41% of adults search for something using voice at least once a day, and for young adults it&#8217;s over half!</h2>
<p><strong>This applies to Google voice search, Alexa home devices, Siri&#8230;anything you can ask a question and expect a result.</strong></p>
<p>The good news is the way we approach SEO for voice search hasn&#8217;t drastically differed.</p>
<p>Yes, voice searches tend to be longer and more conversational. And direct too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example, let&#8217;s say I want to know what the highest mountain is in the UK. Previously I might have entered <em>highest mountain uk</em> into a search engine.</p>
<p>But when asking a voice assistant, I&#8217;m more likely to say something along the lines of tell me <em>what is the highest mountain in the uk. </em>So it&#8217;s longer and more conversational. But despite its length it <strong>is</strong> more direct; I&#8217;m being clearer about what I want to know, which is what the highest one is.</p>
<p>That text search could bring up a page of results that list several high mountains, or articles that talk about a recent event or news story that took place on the highest mountain.</p>
<p>At this point in time search engines are taking these voice questions and dumbing them down for their own purposes. So when a voice search tool is actually working out what results to return, the example above could well be turned into that simpler 3-word version behind the scenes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really going to have an impact is when that directness starts to be factored in a lot more intuitively. Because at that point in time search will become less like looking up relevant information based on a subject (like an old encyclopedia) and more to do with answering really specific questions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very early days to think about how the approach we take to SEO might change when that happens. But the key will be in line with the major engines&#8217; existing ethos &#8211; your website should have a clear purpose, and be written in a natural human readable way so that visitors can easily find the information they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>And in that regard voice search is really just a continuation of the direction the search engines have been heading toward for well over a decade.</p>
