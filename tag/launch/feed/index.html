This is such a project!</p>
<p>David Burnett from Image Control Photography wanted an update for his site, which was based on a very well-known (but it turns out not cross-browser compatible) WordPress theme. He works in the hotly contested wedding photography market, and needed to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I made one myself that is a lot more dependable than the one he bought off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m more of a red and black person and the colour scheme might not be to my personal tastesâ€”but everything is well laid out, easy to read, fully responsive (even on Windows Mobile IE) and has a good mix of high quality photography with text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have a glass of wine to celebrate this one.</p>

So if you find any references in the site to &#8220;photogr<strong>pa</strong>hy&#8221;, that&#8217;s entirely my fault.</p>

<p>He had an online brand that was working pretty well, but then another site that in practice was unrelated, and a desire for a third to help attract different clients, but for a similar product offering.</p>
<p>Step one was to get the existing site working for him, ready to integrate with his personal brand. And that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at, so after quite some years without any change or improvement, <a href="http://shyclinic.com" target="_blank">The Shyness Clinic</a> is finally ready to fly.</p>
