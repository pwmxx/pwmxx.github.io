<p>It gives Facebook a feature that it&#8217;s been lacking, the ability for us to see a stream of activity based around a single theme, site-wide.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great way to build your audience, by joining in threads that reach people far outside your own friends/subscribers list.</p>
<p>And while in a really busy hashtag search your comment will be replaced pretty quickly by the slew of other commentators, if you write the right thing at the right time, you&#8217;ve the potential to massively grow your sphere of influence.</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook has announced plans to introduce clickable hashtags for users.</p>
<p>The tool is already widely used on other media, such as microblogging site Twitter, so users can find out what others are discussing.</p>
<p>Facebook users have long-adopted the hashtag, often using it as an addition to comments and status updates. But they will now be able to click on the hashtagged words as a search term and view a feed of discussions relating to that topic.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your Facebook Page needs to carry a LOT of important messages about you in just a couple of graphics. Too many people just shove their corporate logo up as their Page&#8217;s profile pic, and some large photo they like as the cover image. And certainly sometimes that can be the best option, but in most cases, it&#8217;s a wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>Who are you? Who is your target market? What sort of ethos do you and your business wnat to foster?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t tell people who you are you leave them free reign to form their own ideas about you and your business.</p>
<p>Seriously take a look at your Facebook Page right now. What does it show, at-a-glance, about you and your company?</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t say as much as it could, <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com/hourlie/design-your-facebook-page-for-you/33448" target="_blank">hire me for the ridiculously low sum of Â£19 to sort it out for you.</a></p>

<p>Do bear in mind though, even though your Facebook Page&#8217;s profile picture needs to be 180 pixels square, Facebook actually automatically crops out 10 pixels on all four sides. So basically, create an image that&#8217;s 180px, but know that you&#8217;ll lose a bit around the edges.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also have me do this for you, I make a lot of these for people! In fact, I&#8217;ve done over 100 in the past 12 months.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-766"  title="Search Engine Optimisation (SEO): Social integration Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/facebook-insights-social-networking-seo-150x150.png"  alt="Search Engine Optimisation (SEO): Social integration Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />Social networking is much more than an SEO technique. And while the point of <a title="Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), a primer" href="https://pwmxx.github.io/search-engine-optimisation-seo-a-primer/">this series</a> is to focus on improving your search engine ranking and visibility, it would be reductionist (and actually really difficult) to talk about social media and it&#8217;s relationship to your business without discussing community.</p>
<p>After all, as important as SEO is, its purpose is to build your community of clients, and therefore that tribe of people is the most important thing.</p>
<p>While previous posts in this series focussed on a number of different things you can do, with this topic it all runs together and is a more conceptual dialogue.</p>
<p>1. Backlinks<br />
At its simplest, the explanation of a backlink is, well, simple. Search engines scan social networks and basically count all the links to articles and content on other sites. If you have 50 links back to one article you wrote, you&#8217;ll be seen as having more authority than a site which only gets five.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that social backlinks are given a fairly low importance by the big search engines, so unsurprisingly a link to your post from an article on The Guardian website carries a lot more gravitas. More on that in the next point.</p>
<p>They are however very useful, because they do offer some weight to your content, and it&#8217;s very easy to share content on social media. You&#8217;ll notice at the end of all my blog posts is a share featureâI click all those buttons myself to share my content. It&#8217;s the easiest way.</p>
<p>2. Photos/graphics/images<br />
Before you share your article, make sure it has an image as part of it. Facebook and Linkedin both include a graphic from your content next to the link, and links with images get more clicks. Simple.</p>
<p>A word of advice here from personal experienceâmake sure you have an image in place before you even try to share your content via Facebook once, even if it&#8217;s just a test. Facebook caches the content on links, so if you post once without a graphic and then you remember that you really should have included one so you go back and edit your post then share againâFacebook is probably not going to bother looking for any changes. And you&#8217;re stuck with a text-only link.</p>
<p>3. Social networks<br />
You have a bunch of options for places to post to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook is a no-brainer. Have a page on it, and post your content to it. Make sure the privacy for your posts is &#8220;public&#8221;, and even if you have very few &#8220;likes&#8221;, at least the backlinks are there.</li>
<li>Twitter is a no-brainer. It&#8217;s short, simple, scanned by Google in near real-time, and again, even if you have very few interactions on that network the links to your content exist.</li>
<li>Linkedin is, for almost every professional business, a no-brainer. It&#8217;s where professionals find each other, discuss their industries, and again, if nothing else you&#8217;ve got links back to your content.</li>
<li>Blogs<em> should</em> be a no-brainer. Their potential as social networking is often overlooked, but those comments sections are valuable. Read an article, a few of the comments, then post your own reply with a link to your site. Backlinks ahoy. I include online newspapers and the link as blogs for this purpose; they&#8217;re <em>very</em> widely read. Here&#8217;s a top tip. Once a week, read a really popular blog about your industry. Take 10 minutes to write your own thoughts on the subject, and post that to <strong>your</strong> blog. Then comment on the industry blog saying, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a lot too, and here&#8217;s my recent blog post that might help enlighten things.&#8221; Boom. Your traffic goes up, and you have original content linked to on a popular siteâit doesn&#8217;t matter that you did it yourself.</li>
<li>Tumblr is a great one too. We&#8217;re now in the realm of the networks I call &#8220;time-allowing&#8221;, because while it&#8217;d be nice to hit up every network out there, I also hope you&#8217;re busy making money. But this is worth having a presence on, and sharing your ideas through.</li>
<li>Google+ (a.k.a. Google Plus). I use it because funnily enough, Google search knows what&#8217;s happening on its own social network. I haven&#8217;t made much of setting up my Google+ presence yet simply because there are so many hours in the week. However, I still think this network shows promise for really taking off, and if it does, I want to be established there while other people are playing catch up.</li>
<li>Digg, StumbleUpon, Reddit, Delicious. They&#8217;re all worth a go, and are essentially social bookmarking services. People share bookmarks, rate them up or down, that kind of thing. The one to be slightly wary of is Reddit thoughâwhile it can drive some serious traffic to your site, they have a very close-knit community of users; and if they grab hold of content they don&#8217;t like for one reason or another they will tear it to shreds. And with it your ego.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Community<br />
This is really important, because it&#8217;s not just backlinks that you want, it&#8217;s to have people taking about them, interacting, and ultimately sharing themselves. That in turn brings other people in, and before you know it you have a community of people to sell to. And this is of course the desirable ultimate result.</p>
<p>But people won&#8217;t share content unless it&#8217;s right in their faces, and of interest to them. And also importantly, of perceived interest to their friends. People don&#8217;t share content on social networks because <em>they</em> think it&#8217;s awesome, they share it because they think <em>their friends</em> will think it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s an important distinction.</p>
<p>Part of this community building is for you to interact with your followers and subscribers. If someone looks like they want to get into a debate, then engage with that. If they retweet something you&#8217;ve written, thank them for it. Make them feel included and valued by you. Don&#8217;t leave other people&#8217;s comments hanging out at the tail end of your posts, reply.</p>
<p>Also consider the nature of a community. If all you ever post is backlinks, people will start to overlook your social content. Twitter is a great example, it&#8217;s a very social, social network. Because it&#8217;s so quick to post to, and users expect a fair quantity of tweets to be made by other users, ideally you&#8217;ll post a couple of times a day with something humorous, or clever, or an original inspiring thought, and perhaps post backlinks three times a week. With this sort of ratio you&#8217;re building your community and adding weight to your links.</p>
<p>5. Find opinion leaders<br />
Within any grouping of people, there are those who the rest look up to, and value their opinions. These are the people who naturally settled into a position at the top of the pack, and set the tone for how people interact, what sorts of things they share, but most importantly decide what will be valued by the group. Marketers are always trying to find these people and to get them onside. Have you ever seen those giveaways on Facebook where if you share an advert, and get the most &#8220;likes&#8221; for it, you win something? Well those campaigns aren&#8217;t just about getting brands shared about, they also allow the marketers to see who gets the most likesâand these are the opinion leaders they know to target their advertising towards in future.</p>
<p>My wife is an opinion leader amongst her peers. Whenever she comments on one of my Facebook page&#8217;s posts, or shares it with her friends, that post reaches about five times as many people as a normal one.</p>
<p>Opinion leaders make your shares, backlinks, and social communities much more effective. And bear in mind you want to be one of these people yourself. The go-to-person for a section of your industry. Experts and gurus are opinion leaders.</p>
<p>So start acting like one. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ð" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-428"  title="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warren-ellis-150x150.jpg"  alt="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />Warren Ellis, English author and social commentator, wrote a wonderful post shortly before Christmas in which he discussed the end of the first wave of social media.</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter alters its terms of access to its information, thereby harming the services that built themselves on that information. Which was stupid, because Twitter gets fewer and fewer material benefits from allowing people to use its water. And why would you build a service that relies on a private companyâs assets anyway? Facebook changes its terms of access regularly. Itâs broken its own Pages system and steadily grows more invasive and desperate. Instagram, now owned by Facebook, just went through its first major change in terms of service. Which went as badly as anyone whoâs interacted with Facebook would expect. As Twitter disconnected itself from sharing services like IFTTT, so Instagram disconnected itself from Twitter. Flickrâs experiencing what will probably be a brief renaissance due to having finally built a decent iOS app, but its owners, Yahoo!, are expert in stealing defeat from the jaws of victory. Tumblr seems to me to be spiking in popularity, which coincides neatly with their hiring an advertising sales director away from Groupon, a company described by Techcrunch last year as basically loansharking by any other name.</p>
<p>This may be the end of the cycle that began with Friendster and Livejournal. Not the end of social media, by any means, obviously. But it feels like this is the point at where the current systems seize up for a bit. Perhaps not even in ways that most people will notice. But social media seems now to be clearly calcifying into Big Media, with Big Media problems like cable-style carriage disputes. Frame the Twitter-Instagram spat in terms of Virginmedia not being able to carry Sky Atlantic in the UK, say (I know there are many more US examples).</p></blockquote>
<p>This first wave, or cycle as he calls it, can best be described as one of ecstatic enthusiasm bordering on insanity.</p>
<p>His closing statement wonders if anyone regrets giving up their own websites in favour of just using social platforms yet. I bet the answer is yes, and I&#8217;ve been warning people against that for a long time. More on that another day though.</p>
<p>To focus on the core message of the pieceâyes, he&#8217;s right. People have been so far up social media&#8217;s behind that they forgot to try to turn the lights on to check where they were.</p>
<p>And just where are they? At the mercy of a bunch or other companies who have very right (although very little market-mandate) to change their terms of service and take what you thought was yours.</p>
<p>Issues of content ownership and the like aside though, I&#8217;ve been waiting for this bubble to burst for a long while&mdash;because it&#8217;s time to simply accept social media, rather than jumping up and down on the sofa about it.</p>
<p>Is social media exciting? Of course. New technology, ways to reach your audience and methods of interaction always are. But they aren&#8217;t the be-all and end-all. Television still has exciting content. Radio programs can still blow my mind.</p>
<p>Once all the hype settles down, content becomes the clarifying point, sorting the overly excited from the thoughtful.</p>
<p>When approaching social media for any business purpose, look at it in the context of all your online work, sites, portfolios, information, etc. If you just think outside the box a little bit, you can have a very large and well rounded arsenal of online communications at your disposal. Which can all work together to improve your bottom line.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting for a long time for people to realise that as exciting and useful as social media is, it&#8217;s one tool you have at your disposal, and you have many. Make them all work together, for you.</p>
<p>Think of it like this, there will always be new waves. And just watching them from the beach is no good, you need to ride them. But stay on top of them where you can see what&#8217;s happening around you, rather than falling in and finding you&#8217;ve crashed up on a beach with no David Hasselhoff in sight.</p>

<p>I logged into Facebook yesterday to find the list of groups I was a part of was <em>huge.</em> Well over a hundred, some I left years ago, some I barely recognised (short lived in-jokes from 2007) and others I wish I didn&#8217;t remember.</p>
<p>I was suddenly a member of every group I&#8217;d ever joined, even ones that had been deleted years ago.</p>
<p>Further proof that Facebook really does remember everything we doâforever.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, groups I set up, and had needed to remove people a few people from over the years (for unacceptable behaviour) had all the offenders and their content reinstated.</p>
<p>Facebook have admitted there was a mistake, which on the one hand is positive, at least they&#8217;re standing up to say an error was made.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re being honest about how many people it&#8217;s affected. Everyone I&#8217;ve interacted with over the past 24 hours has had it crop up. But my main concern is simply that an error like this was able to happen. People who had left groups, private, closed groups, were now able to see all the content since they left.</p>
<p>It was a mistake sure, but mistakes of this magnitude shouldn&#8217;t be happening in a company the size of Facebook. I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if I test the online communities, sites and systems I&#8217;m involved with more rigorously.</p>
<p>After all, I&#8217;ve never had a privacy scare. Not one. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ð" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>When all is said and done though, and statements are issued and emergency fixed made, here&#8217;s my final take on the whole thing:</p>

Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;m the first to admit, I struggled with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> at first. Not that it&#8217;s hard to use or anything, in fact it&#8217;s incredibly simple. But I struggled to find its place in my social-media-life.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/peterwm/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve had my profile</a> up there for years, and I&#8217;d fleshed it out (past jobs, current responsibilities, photo, all the things that seemed important) but I wasn&#8217;t interacting with anyone.</p>
<p>All my colleagues and ex-colleagues were on Facebook. LinkedIn let me post messages and share other people&#8217;s updates, but so much less then my other social profiles.</p>
<p>Then I started using it regularly; I just made sure I logged in a couple of times a week. Recommended a couple of people. Wrote to someone I could only find on LinkedIn that I hadn&#8217;t spoken to for a while.</p>
<p>Before I knew it I became a regular. And the more I used it, the more people found me. Job offers, professional queries, community discussions, they&#8217;ve all become an important part of what I do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found even people I do communicate with elsewhere interact differently on LinkedIn. We act in the way we want to present ourselves to our workmates, bosses and clients.</p>
<p>This is the advantage of LinkedIn. Not only can you build your online community, but you can be sure that your interactions on it are going to be framed in a professional manner, and of a higher quality. To this day I&#8217;ve not seen a single photo of a kitten on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t be the first.</p>
