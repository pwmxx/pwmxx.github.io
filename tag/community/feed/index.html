<p>People tend to look at most of these elements in a microcosm. &#8220;How&#8217;s your SEO?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you making the most of social networking?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seeing these as separate hinders your efforts to build and strengthen your online community, which you need to care about because those are the people who will pay for your products and services.</p>
<p>My five pillars are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Ubuntu;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Core messages</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Ubuntu;"><span style="font-size: medium;">SEO</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Ubuntu;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Community</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Ubuntu;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Social Networking</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Ubuntu;"><span style="font-size: medium;">User experience</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a great deal of crossover between them, as there should be when you&#8217;re looking at the big picture rather than focusing on single points.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I&#8217;m going to describe each one in brief, and in the interests of pith I&#8217;ll also do a tweetinar soon, summing the whole thing up in five tweets. That&#8217;s going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I love a good challenge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to think that having lots more followers on Twitter than people you followed made you look good, that the ratio was important.</p>
<p>And perhaps at a cursory glance it does. But with so many services devoted to getting your stats up, (<a href="http://twiends.com/" target="_blank">twiends</a> being a case in point) it all starts to become a bit meagingless.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder, how do I want to use Twitter?</p>
<p>Is it just a feather in my cap, proving that I can be popular (incidentially, I&#8217;m, not yet)? Frankly, I&#8217;d rather let my body of work speak to my successes.</p>
<p>I love community, and conversation. I want discussion. But I don&#8217;t want that discussion hampered by a endless supply of tweets clogging my feed from people I&#8217;ll never interact with.</p>
<p>A good community of people makes for a useful experience. People who talk to each other, to debate and share.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just a matter of lists. Any leader is in part defined by his/her followers. When people look at my list of followers, I want them to see quality people they might want to interact with too.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION=FOLLOWERS&gt;2,000,000<br />
If you become popular enough, you can stay popular just for that reason. Get enough people following you, and your list of followers isn&#8217;t indicative of your peers anymore, but just that you&#8217;re a social trend. See <a href="http://twitter.com/markhoppus" target="_blank">@markhoppus</a> for an example, albeit a funny one at that.</p>
