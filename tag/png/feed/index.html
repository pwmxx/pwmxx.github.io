										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Please remember when saving images to upload to the web &#8211; photos should be saved as JPGs.</h2>
<p><strong>PNG is another popular format for the web but it works best on images like logos, with large blocks of the same colour.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2359" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-440x231.png" alt="" width="440" height="231" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-440x231.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-240x126.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-600x315.png 600w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-768x403.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos.png 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Anything like a photograph that is made up of 1000s of different colours will always be best as a JPG &#8211; and usually about one 10th the filesize.</p>
<p>Of the clients that ask me to speed up their WordPress websites (in addition to their <a title="Wordpress SEO" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">SEO work</a>) perhaps the most improvement comes from simply converting their photos they&#8217;ve saved as PNGs into JPGs. If a site has several photos that are saved as the wrong file type it&#8217;s easy to shave several megabytes off the page size, and therefore speed up the site&#8217;s loading time.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is a lot of software for editing images will default to PNG when you use their &#8220;Save for web&#8221; function. Which is fine for icons and logos, charts and even text saved as an image.</p>
<p>So many websites these days focus on really high quality imagery (understandably &#8211; people <em>love</em> photographs!) but don&#8217;t know that not all file types are created equally, they all have different purposes and use cases and those wonderful product shots should <strong>always</strong> be saved as JPGs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to get in the habit of doing this right away &#8211; after an image is uploaded into WordPress there&#8217;s no simply way to convert it to JPG and change all the references in the code to use the different filename. So try to get it right from the outset!</p>
