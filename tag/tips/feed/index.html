								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My WordPress site is so fast, I’m not even sure I can call it WordPress anymore.</h2>
<p><strong>Static site generators are awesome.</strong></p>
<p>They create blindingly fast sites, with very few drawbacks (more on those later).</p>
<p>But I’ve been using WordPress since it was a small blogging platform call b2. I’m used to it, I like it, and already have a swag of sites built on it for myself; not just my clients.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">I work in SEO</a> speed is really crucial to what I do. I do a lot of caching and optimisation work for people, but wanted to see what would happen if I really pushed the envelope out.</p>
<p>Initially I was keen to make a front-end that pulled data out of a basic WordPress install using JSON. I set up a proof-of-concept successfully, but wasn’t so keen on remaking all my layouts and front-end design from scratch for it. Besides, basic things like the WordPress menu editor, text widgets etc. are something I very much enjoy using.</p>
<p>I did some research, and came across a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP2Static.</a> It’s a slick plugin that basically does just what I wanted – it packages up WordPress sites as static sites you can deploy anywhere. With a bit of configuring you can actually use it to output to a folder on the same server, and use some basic .htaccess rules so that becomes the public facing side of things.</p>
<p>Which is cool, but I wanted to go for MAXIMUM SPEED. My end goal was to get the site hosted on GitHub Pages, and then use Cloudflare to CDN it around the world.</p>
<p>(WP2Static does actually have a system to deploy to GitHub Pages built-in, but I found the deployment process just too slow.)</p>
<p>So when I considered everything I was trying to achieve, which included keeping the live site on the same URL it was already on, I opted to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>move the WordPress install of my site off its current server, onto my localhost machine (it’s fast and I back it up regularly)</li>
<li>use WP2Static to output the site to a local folder</li>
<li>use git via the terminal to publish the site</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, for a nerd, it seems fairly straightforward. And on the whole it worked much more easily than I anticipated. The main glitches to overcome were that a number of font files weren’t being picked up by the plugin for inclusion in the static site. But it has a configuration option to force it to include certain file paths, so that was easily overcome.</p>
<p>I did need to create a manual 404.html page (GitHub Pages looks for that in the top directory of a site) but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>There were a few other tiny things that were really specific to my own WordPress setup – like realising my sitemap.xml file needed to be a flat XML file rather than an index linking to other XML files – because they weren’t going to be wrapped up by the plugin.</p>
<p>The thing you really lose with any static site system though is (logically) user interaction. In my case that was just forms, but I was happy to replace my contact form with a simple email address – anything else I might need in the future I can do by embedding forms directly from another system like Google Forms.</p>
<p>I used to sell a couple of SEO packages directly through my site, but Woocommerce was always overkill for that anyway. In the future I’ll just use a combination of Paypal buttons to replicate the same functionality – and in fact it’ll be simpler for the end user because I don’t need to know all their billing address information to start an SEO job with them.</p>
<p>The really big day-to-day drawback is that clicking ‘Publish’ in WordPress doesn’t publish anything anymore. The process to run a new export with WP2Static and then send it to GitHub Pages takes about two minutes. But considering how often I blog or change anything on the site that’s not a major issue. Like with anything, you need to weigh up the processes, pros and cons against how you actually use something to determine if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>The site I did all this too, fyi, is the one you’re on right now. This is a static site, hosted for free on GitHub Pages and replicated on servers around the world using Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Google PageSpeed Insights gives a 99% speed rating for Desktop. And the missing 1% is simply because I include an external file that I can’t set an expiration header for – ironically that file is the script for Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Pingdom (my preferred speed testing system, because you can choose a server location for the real-world load-time to be tested against – so if your clients are predominantly in London then choose that server to get an idea of the speed as they’ll see it) gives the homepage a 0.212 second loading time. For something ultimately based on WordPress as a content management system, that’s impressive.</p>

Now there are a variety of ways this can be done, from removing the &#8220;related videos&#8221; at the end (which I <em>always</em> do for schools, at the American School in London we must have done this a hundred times a month!) to overlaying images on top of the video entirely, (see <a href="http://www.danielwagner.com" target="_blank">danielwagner.com</a> for an example).</p>
<p>But like so many things online, as long as you know the basics yourself, there&#8217;s a lot you can do with those.</p>
<p>Just adding little bits of code to the Youtube URL for example can have a big effect.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote><p>4. Hide the search box</p>
<p>The search box appears when you hover over an embedded video. To hide the search box add ‘&amp;showsearch=0′ to the embed url.</p></blockquote>

You want your tribe to be well-positioned, and desirable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just just new members either, but existing ones want to know they&#8217;re a part of something exciting, something that ranks highly. Something prestigious.</p>
<p>The &#8220;meta tags&#8221; in your site&#8217;s code are really important here. There&#8217;s a science behind it of course, but it&#8217;s something you want an expert like myself to help you with. They&#8217;re small pieces of code that search engines read to get a better ides of what your site is about, and what keywords it should look for.</p>
<p>However, here&#8217;s one of the tricks of the trade you can use yourself. This tool gives you feedback and advice regarding your meta data, helpfully colour coded for people who don&#8217;t want to worry about interpreting too much of it.</p>
<p>My favourite metric it returns is to check how relevant your keywords are to your content. This is an absolute must, and something to look at for all your pages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit technical, but the colour coding helps.</p>
<p>Mind you, so can I.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an essential.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you haven’t already included LinkedIn in your company’s online social media efforts, then you should certainly consider adding a LinkedIn company page to your web presence arsenal. LinkedIn is considered one of the most influential social media platforms on the web, and can make a huge difference in terms of your business’ social media marketing strategy.</p>
<p>A LinkedIn page can connect you with a really wide net of potential partners, customers, suppliers and helpful contacts, and requires a lot less regular attention than many of your other social media accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>via <a href="http://www.famousbloggers.net/company-linkedin-page.html" target="_blank">5 Tips for Creating Your Company Linkedin Page</a>.</p>
<p>Honestly, there are so many good reasons to be using it. I accept that if you&#8217;re used to the concepts of social networking that you&#8217;ll pick up using Facebook or Twitter it can seem a bit odd, but it&#8217;s networking, it&#8217;s social, and has a built in professional audience looking to make money.</p>
