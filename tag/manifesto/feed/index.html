								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1533" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/seo-backlinks-lies-440x150.jpg" alt="seo-backlinks-lies" width="440" height="150" />Here&#8217;s a pretty typical advert you&#8217;ll see online when searching for SEO, &#8220;I can create 33 SEO backlink Panda Penguin safe from PR10&#8221;.</p>
<p>The trouble is it&#8217;s all <strong>LIES.</strong></p>
<p>I know I bang on about the trouble with buying backlinks to try to help your SEO. Regular readers will be familiar with my disdain for people selling the impossible—since Google&#8217;s Panda algorithm tries very hard to find people buying links, saying any scheme like this is &#8220;Panda safe&#8221; or even worse, &#8220;Panda friendly&#8221; is a massive fib.</p>
<p>So at the risk of repeating myself, I&#8217;m going to say some things I&#8217;ve said before &#8211; albeit in a more concise and succinct form.</p>
<p>It is true that Google does like to see links to your site. But they are excellent at discerning real links (where someone liked your site or service enough to link to it) from purchased ones. Those bought ones are usually just low quality directories and profiles. When I say profiles I really mean it, user accounts get created on the Apple website that have your domain in the user description and the scam-sellers have the nerve to say that&#8217;s a PR10 link from a high quality domain. As if Google can&#8217;t tell the difference between say, a news story on the BBC and a bunch of comment-user accounts.</p>
<p>I generally stand against buying backlinks because of my <em>SEO ethos.</em> My ethos is simple by the way &#8211; Google have given us a swag of information regarding what search engines do and do not want &#8211; so I say we give them what they&#8217;re after. But on the flipside we need to be sure to avoid what they <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want.</p>
<p>I have about three jobs a week come in from people who bought back links and got caught &#8211; and dropped off Google completely. When they penalise you, they <strong>really</strong> hit you hard.</p>
<p>Technically speaking really awesome backlinks would certainly help your SEO. But 99% of the time buying them is not awesome, and I recommend avoiding it.</p>
<p>I (like Google) see SEO as a long game, if done properly. But also, if done properly, it &#8220;sticks&#8221;. A site with good SEO that&#8217;s risen to the top should stay at the top.</p>
<p>And with that, I shall get down from my well-trodden soap-box.</p>
