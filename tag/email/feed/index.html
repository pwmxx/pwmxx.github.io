								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img  title="Moving email between servers Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1762" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/move-email-between-servers-600x315.png"  alt="Moving email between servers Peter Mahoney"  width="600" height="315" />There are plenty of reason to move servers for your website, but email is often an afterthought. Even though it&#8217;s something we use hundreds of times a week.</p>
<p>Speed issues, cost and possibly (hopefully) needing to upgrade to cope with all your traffic are all excellent reasons to consider a server move.</p>
<p>Moving the website is one thing, files, databases and DNS work all need to be done &#8211; but what about all your emails? Inbox, folder, sent items, drafts. How do you get those across?</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a server admin with full control over them, then this post isn&#8217;t for you. Because you have some clear pathways to move email from the old server to the new one.</p>
<p>But what about everyone else? The 99% of people who just pay for shared space with an existing hosting company, who just have a web based control panel (like Plesk or cPanel) they log into?</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s you, prepare for pain. Well, to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Simply put there&#8217;s never been a decent tool made to move email from server to server.</p>
<p>If you connect to your email currently via POP, that will mean you&#8217;re downloading your email to you local computer and therefore have a local copy. So losing the email from the existing server wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
<p>If you connect via IMAP (and most people do) then all your email is stored on the server, and would be lost. In this case you have 3 courses of action*:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be prepared to lose your existing email.</li>
<li>Change it so you do connect via POP, then have all that email download to your local machine. The downside with this is usually you&#8217;d only end up with the emails on one machine. If you&#8217;re used to checking the same email accounts via perhaps two computers and a mobile, then you&#8217;d lose the option to have old emails on those.</li>
<li>Get the new server setup and running. Set up the new email address (using IMAP too) and get those all setup on your computer. Then connect to the old email accounts again (you&#8217;ll need to change the server address to the IP address, which is a tad cumbersome). But then the really awful bit comes in, you have to drag the emails from the old accounts to the new &#8211; and because they&#8217;re set up on your local machine it downloads them all then uploads them as it copies them across. Sometimes I can copy a folder at a time, sometimes you need to do emails one at a time &#8211; it depends on the setup of the old server.</li>
</ol>
<p>That last one is a horrible job. I&#8217;ve done it on request before, but for an average small office email setup it can easily take a day.</p>
<p>My preference is to start again. Suck up that there&#8217;s going to be email lost, make sure you have copies of any current message threads and communication, and bite the bullet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* = If you&#8217;re moving from one type of hosting control panel to another one that&#8217;s the same (for example cPanel to cPanel) &#8211; you have another option fortunately. Again it&#8217;s messy: you need to download your mail folder then recreate all the same email accounts on the new server and upload the mail folder to the same place on that new server. This often falls down though because of permissions issues, or server settings you can&#8217;t control (where mail is stored, etc.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We spend a lot of time worrying about the Data Protection Act (1998) when marketing here in the UK. It&#8217;s outdated and therefore unnecessarily restrictive.</p>
<p>It also means there&#8217;s a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation flying around about it.</p>
<p>When I worked at the American School in London we sought legal advise as early as 2005, and even then we were told it was impossible to uphold the Act to the letter, and the important thing was to demonstrate that we upheld the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of it! And that was seven years ago.</p>
<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office is a great place to go for useful information on how the Data Protection Act (1998) really impacts us.</p>
<p>Part of building your online community is that you&#8217;re going to want to communicate with them (sorry to state the obvious) and that means the law regarding how you can collect their addresses, and how you can use them becomes really important.</p>
<p>The big question has always been opt-in versus opt-out. Do we need users to give us express permission before we contact them, or can we assume (or even just hope) that they&#8217;re OK with it?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant information straight from the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office. To be honest, it&#8217;s better than most people think.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Electronic mail marketing</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that you can only carry out unsolicited electronic marketing if the person you&#8217;re targeting has given you their permission.</p>
<p>However, there is an exception to this rule. Known as the &#8216;soft opt-in&#8217; it applies if the following conditions are met;</p>
<p>where you&#8217;ve obtained a person&#8217;s details in the course of a sale or negotiations for a sale of a product or service;</p>
<p>where the messages are only marketing similar products or services; and</p>
<p>where the person is given a simple opportunity to refuse marketing when their details are collected, and if they don&#8217;t opt out at this point, are given a simple way to do so in future messages.</p>
<p>When you send an electronic marketing message, you must tell the recipient who you are and provide a valid contact address.</p>
<p>The rules on emails don&#8217;t apply to emails sent to organisations, though you must still identify yourself and provide an address.</p>
<p>The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) and Fax Preference Service (FPS) are operated by the Direct Marketing Association, and allow people to register their numbers to opt out of receiving unsolicted calls or faxes. You must not market individuals or organisations who have registered their numbers with the TPS or FPS.</p>
<p>In summary, we recommend that your marketing campaigns are always permission-based and you explain clearly what a person&#8217;s details will be used for. Provide a simple way for them to opt out of marketing messages and have a system in place for dealing with complaints.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difficulty is if you&#8217;re starting a mailing list and you already have a database of people you want to put on it. That requires some creative thinking.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a big Gmail fan, and use it as my primary email for *@webcraft.co. It may not look from the address like it&#8217;s Gmail, but it is.</p>
<p>A personal tweak I like was to change the settings so that when I reply, my rather snazzy email signature appears at the top under the cursor (so it will be directly beneath my reply) rather than all the way at the bottom of what can be a fairly long email thread.</p>
<p>To do this, just go to Settings &gt; Labs, and look for &#8220;Signature tweaks&#8221;. There&#8217;s only one option, so just enable that and you&#8217;re done!</p>
