I&#8217;m slightly more than geeky when it comes to tech, and I&#8217;ve been wearing these huge glasses <em>way</em> before hipsters first picked them up.</p>
<p>However, there are a few things about me that separate me out from the nerd crowd. And one of the biggies is&#8230;I can communicate, with you, in a way you&#8217;ll understand. In fact a few of my clients about a decade ago took to calling me &#8220;The geek who can speak&#8221;. At the time I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should be flattered or flummoxed. I&#8217;m still unsure.</p>
<p>Anyway, quite famously, when you seek advice from a nerd they&#8217;re likely to respond &#8220;Have you tried turning it on and off again&#8221;, and for good reasonâ€”it usually works.</p>
<p>I had an interaction with a support helpdesk this morning; one of their WordPress themes was playing up and I submitted a support ticket, knowing that it would take them at least 24 hours to get to it, so I was hoping for a helpful reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you upgraded to the latest version?&#8221; was all I got back. Fullstop. It&#8217;s the software equivalent of hitting the power button twice, because it is, to most developers mind&#8217;s, the most likely thing to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The other thing it has in common with making use of the on/off switch, is it&#8217;s the path of least resistance. Now, personally I take offence when asked by anyone, in any situation, &#8220;Have you done the least thing you possible could without having done nothing?&#8221; and this situation is no different.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m sharing this to give some practical advice. When writing to support lines about online products, use this easy to follow formula:</p>
<blockquote><p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I have updated my software to the latest version as available from your website, but am still finding that {insert rest of issue here}.</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied to the less-than-welcome response I got of course, just a few minutes ago. And now I&#8217;m going to wait the inevitable 24 hours for the follow-up.</p>
<p>I just hope for everyone&#8217;s sake that they don&#8217;t come back asking me to restart the web server. I&#8217;ve had these giant glasses a long time, and I&#8217;m not afraid to use them.</p>
