								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>We&#8217;ve known for a long time that how fast your site loads is important for SEO.</h2>
<p><strong>Google have <em>increased</em> the importance of your website&#8217;s mobile speed when working out where to rank it.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been true for a while that there&#8217;s been some small impact on your ranking based on mobile speed (desktop speed has been important for years) but now that&#8217;s been ramped up.</p>
<p>The most important metrics they use remain the sort of SEO work I do in the code and the quality of your content &#8211; but when those things are being looked after mobile speed is where you should turn your attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the automated tests out there tend to be a bit alarmist <a href="https://peterwm.com/problems-with-google-pagespeed-insights/">(I blogged about that recently)</a> but they can still serve as a reminder that there&#8217;s nearly always room for improvement.</p>
<p>WordPress certainly has its issues with speed. And most themes are still being built for desktop-first (meaning how it looks on a desktop computer is the primary concern, and then it&#8217;s cut down and limited for mobile) when in fact current standards are clear that mobile-first should be the designers focus.</p>
<p>Be aware that although the testing systems are imperfect, and WordPress is very hard to score upwards of 80% with on most systems &#8211; the faster your site is the better.</p>
<p>In fact, mobile speed is now more important than desktop speed as a ranking metric for Google.</p>
<p>As a general piece of advice, my favourite tool for testing a site&#8217;s overall speed (not mobile specific) is <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pingdom.</a></p>
<p>They give you a list of different servers to choose from; so it&#8217;s easier to get a real-world figure for your loading time in seconds &#8211; just like your target market will see it. Choose the nearest server to your primary audience, et voila.</p>

<p>(Although none of the online speed testing tools are perfect, Pingdom has a lot of useful features.)</p>
