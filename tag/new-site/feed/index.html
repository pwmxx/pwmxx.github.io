<p>There&#8217;s a new force in Digital Marketing in New Zealand &#8211; which I may have more than a little to do with.</p>
<p>As an ex-New Zealander I still like to keep myself appraised of what&#8217;s going on down there, and have decided to throw my hat in their digital marketing ring. People who have worked with me before will know I work a little differently:</p>
<p><em>No nonsense, up front pricing, and everything delivered on time and on budget.</em></p>
<p>And every market needs a company like that!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://pwm.nz">Purple Web Marketing in NZ</a> is a new company I&#8217;ll be overseeing, but it&#8217;s a team effort rather than just myself. I&#8217;ve been using contractors to help out as the business has grown, but it&#8217;s time to call a spade a spade and say it&#8217;s a proper agency.</p>
<p>The UK business will be brought up to speed as well in the next few weeks, becoming the UK headquarters for Purple Web Marketing. So make the most of this black website while you can &#8211; it&#8217;s all going very purple very soon.</p>
<p>I remember at high school a guidance counselor once promised that &#8220;one day, we&#8217;ll all be working remotely from anywhere in the world!&#8221; and I&#8217;m pleased to say she was right. You&#8217;ll find me all over the place, working hard and delivering great results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually do resolutions or anything like that, but as this site is now a few years old it makes sense to resolve to make myself a new one.</p>
<p>It might take a bit longer than usual because I&#8217;ll be doing it all with a &#8220;static site generator&#8221;, which is simply a useful way to generate sites that don&#8217;t have really advanced features, like e-commerce. But it allows for blindingly fast sites (in fact they load about 4x faster than a WordPress site!) so is a good direction to head in.</p>
<p>Of course if you want a <a href="/wordpress-website-development/">new website for 2018,</a> or just to make sure your existing one <a href="/one-off-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">gets as many visitors as possible,</a> let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all year.</p>

This is such a project!</p>
<p>David Burnett from Image Control Photography wanted an update for his site, which was based on a very well-known (but it turns out not cross-browser compatible) WordPress theme. He works in the hotly contested wedding photography market, and needed to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I made one myself that is a lot more dependable than the one he bought off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m more of a red and black person and the colour scheme might not be to my personal tastesâ€”but everything is well laid out, easy to read, fully responsive (even on Windows Mobile IE) and has a good mix of high quality photography with text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have a glass of wine to celebrate this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://imagecontrolphotography.co.uk/" target="_blank">imagecontrolphotography.co.uk</a></p>
<p><img  title="New site: Essex Wedding Photographers Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1400"  alt="New site: Essex Wedding Photographers Peter Mahoney"  src="https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-440x585.jpg" width="440" height="585" srcset="https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-440x585.jpg 440w, https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-180x240.jpg 180w, https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers.jpg 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" />PS, Dave, my one confession is for some reason, the way I type doesn&#8217;t allow me to ever spell &#8220;photography&#8221; correctly. So if you find any references in the site to &#8220;photogr<strong>pa</strong>hy&#8221;, that&#8217;s entirely my fault.</p>

<p>He had an online brand that was working pretty well, but then another site that in practice was unrelated, and a desire for a third to help attract different clients, but for a similar product offering.</p>
<p>Step one was to get the existing site working for him, ready to integrate with his personal brand. And that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at, so after quite some years without any change or improvement, <a href="http://shyclinic.com" target="_blank">The Shyness Clinic</a> is finally ready to fly.</p>
