										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was having all kind of trouble installing Ubuntu Server today. I tried writing the disc image to a USB in a variety of ways, but it kept failing at various points of the install, check disks never succeeded, and I couldn&#8217;t help but notice I wasn&#8217;t even seeing a couple of the screens I expected too.</p>
<p>Over lunch I found this:</p>
<pre>Due to changes in syslinux, it is not currently possible to use usb-creator from 14.04 and earlier releases to write USB images for 15.04 or later; we believe that it is also not possible to use usb-creator from a 15.04 or later system to write USB images for earlier releases. For now the workaround is to use a matching release of Ubuntu to write the images, but we intend to issue updates soon to work around this incompatibility</pre>
<p>So the issue was the computer I was creating the USB on wasn&#8217;t compatible with the Ubuntu server image I was creating.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click your ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso > Open with Disk Image writer</li>
<li>Choose your usb drive and click Start Restoring&#8230; and follow the instruction.</li>
