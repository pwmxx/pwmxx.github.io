<p>Posting a USB memory stick costs more than a regular letter. Many people just pop them in envelopes and stick a standard second class stamp on it, thinking nothing of it.</p>
<p>And fair enough, you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking something so small should count as a standard letter.</p>
<p>Sadly, they&#8217;re generally too thick to be accepted that way, and the recipients end up with a small (but annoying) fee to pay at their local Post Office. Easily the most frustrating thing is usually the postage is only 19p short, to which a pound gets added as a handling feeâ€”and thus the Royal Mail makes more on the transaction than it would cost to send the item twice.</p>
<p>(If you&#8217;re on of the people who has recently fallen foul of this when sending me USB sticks, fret not, I have no plans to come after you! Just to show there are no hard feelings, a few bricks are on their way to you, affixed with a single used stamp from New Zealand. Don&#8217;t get upset with me, they&#8217;re too large to fit through your mail slot so you were always going to have to visit your local Post Office for collection anyway.)</p>
