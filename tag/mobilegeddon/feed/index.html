But it&#8217;s worth knowing it&#8217;s now official &#8211; Google has confirmed that more searches are performed on mobile phones and tablets than traditional PCs/laptops.</p>
<p>It makes their last major update well timed &#8211; just a couple of weeks ago they made sure mobile friendly sites would have priority in mobile-based search results over sites that are not.</p>
<p>But this does mean if your site isn&#8217;t mobile friendly, we have the stats to hand that show you ARE missing out of search engine potential. <a title="Contact" href="https://pwmxx.github.io/contact/">Contact me</a> and I can help.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img  title="Mobilegeddon Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1591" src="https://pwmxx.github.io/content/uploads/2015/04/mobilegeddon2-ss-1920-800x450-440x150.jpg"  alt="Mobilegeddon Peter Mahoney"  width="440" height="150" />It&#8217;s a catchy name for a simple, but important change.</p>
<p>Since April 21, Google has been ranking sites that are mobile friendly higher in search results&#8211;but only for searches performed on mobile devices.</p>
<p>So if I use my phone to look for a photographer &#8211; sites that are mobile friendly are going to come up before those that are not.</p>
<p>If I do the same search on my desktop, they won&#8217;t (as much).</p>
<p>There are two main things to take away from this:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is an important change, and you should check that your site is mobile friendly immediately. You can do that using <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s own tool.<br />
</a>If your site fails, let me know and we&#8217;ll do something about it.</li>
<li>The other thing to keep in mind is this is just the start, it&#8217;s clear Google intends to roll this out to all searches, regardless of whether the search was performed on a desktop, tablet or mobile. It&#8217;s only a matter of time until all search rankings are affected&#8211;so make sure your site is mobile friendly.</li>
</ol>
