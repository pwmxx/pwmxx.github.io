<p>There&#8217;s a new force in Digital Marketing in New Zealand &#8211; which I may have more than a little to do with.</p>
<p>As an ex-New Zealander I still like to keep myself appraised of what&#8217;s going on down there, and have decided to throw my hat in their digital marketing ring. People who have worked with me before will know I work a little differently:</p>
<p><em>No nonsense, up front pricing, and everything delivered on time and on budget.</em></p>
<p>And every market needs a company like that!</p>
<p>ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><a href="https://pwm.nz">Purple Web Marketing in NZ</a> is a new company I&#8217;ll be overseeing, but it&#8217;s a team effort rather than just myself. I&#8217;ve been using contractors to help out as the business has grown, but it&#8217;s time to call a spade a spade and say it&#8217;s a proper agency.</p>
<p>The UK business will be brought up to speed as well in the next few weeks, becoming the UK headquarters for Purple Web Marketing. So make the most of this black website while you can &#8211; it&#8217;s all going very purple very soon.</p>
<p>I remember at high school a guidance counselor once promised that &#8220;one day, we&#8217;ll all be working remotely from anywhere in the world!&#8221; and I&#8217;m pleased to say she was right. You&#8217;ll find me all over the place, working hard and delivering great results.</p>
