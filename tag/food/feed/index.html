<ol>
<li>There isn&#8217;t enough of it in the world</li>
<li>I&#8217;m providing a service, and conduct myself as such</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t get precious about things like a lot of developers and designers do. (Honestly, people need to get over themselves sometimes!)</li>
<li>And this one&#8217;s really important; I both take pride in my work, and feed my family with it. Anything less than a five-star service means I&#8217;ll have less than a perfect reputation, which keeps food off my children&#8217;s table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 3. is a particularly interested topic&#8211;I have known people who get so precious that they refuse to deliver what their client asks for!</p>
<p>Certainly, as a consultant and professional with 17 years experience, if I think a project or part thereof should be done differently to the brief, I&#8217;ll suggest it with a solid rationale. But I also accept that if someone really wants to stick with their idea, they should be able too.</p>
<p>In some cases it boils down to this, I <em>know</em> web development, design, and online community&#8211;but my clients know their own businesses better than I! That&#8217;s why I like to get to know my clients and their businesses, because I want to make sure they&#8217;re using the web as effectively as they can for their business model.</p>
