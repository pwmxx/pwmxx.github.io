								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My WordPress site is so fast, I’m not even sure I can call it WordPress anymore.</h2>
<p><strong>Static site generators are awesome.</strong></p>
<p>They create blindingly fast sites, with very few drawbacks (more on those later).</p>
<p>But I’ve been using WordPress since it was a small blogging platform call b2. I’m used to it, I like it, and already have a swag of sites built on it for myself; not just my clients.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">I work in SEO</a> speed is really crucial to what I do. I do a lot of caching and optimisation work for people, but wanted to see what would happen if I really pushed the envelope out.</p>
<p>Initially I was keen to make a front-end that pulled data out of a basic WordPress install using JSON. I set up a proof-of-concept successfully, but wasn’t so keen on remaking all my layouts and front-end design from scratch for it. Besides, basic things like the WordPress menu editor, text widgets etc. are something I very much enjoy using.</p>
<p>I did some research, and came across a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP2Static.</a> It’s a slick plugin that basically does just what I wanted – it packages up WordPress sites as static sites you can deploy anywhere. With a bit of configuring you can actually use it to output to a folder on the same server, and use some basic .htaccess rules so that becomes the public facing side of things.</p>
<p>Which is cool, but I wanted to go for MAXIMUM SPEED. My end goal was to get the site hosted on GitHub Pages, and then use Cloudflare to CDN it around the world.</p>
<p>(WP2Static does actually have a system to deploy to GitHub Pages built-in, but I found the deployment process just too slow.)</p>
<p>So when I considered everything I was trying to achieve, which included keeping the live site on the same URL it was already on, I opted to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>move the WordPress install of my site off its current server, onto my localhost machine (it’s fast and I back it up regularly)</li>
<li>use WP2Static to output the site to a local folder</li>
<li>use git via the terminal to publish the site</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, for a nerd, it seems fairly straightforward. And on the whole it worked much more easily than I anticipated. The main glitches to overcome were that a number of font files weren’t being picked up by the plugin for inclusion in the static site. But it has a configuration option to force it to include certain file paths, so that was easily overcome.</p>
<p>I did need to create a manual 404.html page (GitHub Pages looks for that in the top directory of a site) but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>There were a few other tiny things that were really specific to my own WordPress setup – like realising my sitemap.xml file needed to be a flat XML file rather than an index linking to other XML files – because they weren’t going to be wrapped up by the plugin.</p>
<p>The thing you really lose with any static site system though is (logically) user interaction. In my case that was just forms, but I was happy to replace my contact form with a simple email address – anything else I might need in the future I can do by embedding forms directly from another system like Google Forms.</p>
<p>I used to sell a couple of SEO packages directly through my site, but Woocommerce was always overkill for that anyway. In the future I’ll just use a combination of Paypal buttons to replicate the same functionality – and in fact it’ll be simpler for the end user because I don’t need to know all their billing address information to start an SEO job with them.</p>
<p>The really big day-to-day drawback is that clicking ‘Publish’ in WordPress doesn’t publish anything anymore. The process to run a new export with WP2Static and then send it to GitHub Pages takes about two minutes. But considering how often I blog or change anything on the site that’s not a major issue. Like with anything, you need to weigh up the processes, pros and cons against how you actually use something to determine if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>The site I did all this too, fyi, is the one you’re on right now. This is a static site, hosted for free on GitHub Pages and replicated on servers around the world using Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Google PageSpeed Insights gives a 99% speed rating for Desktop. And the missing 1% is simply because I include an external file that I can’t set an expiration header for – ironically that file is the script for Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Pingdom (my preferred speed testing system, because you can choose a server location for the real-world load-time to be tested against – so if your clients are predominantly in London then choose that server to get an idea of the speed as they’ll see it) gives the homepage a 0.212 second loading time. For something ultimately based on WordPress as a content management system, that’s impressive.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually do resolutions or anything like that, but as this site is now a few years old it makes sense to resolve to make myself a new one.</p>
<p>It might take a bit longer than usual because I&#8217;ll be doing it all with a &#8220;static site generator&#8221;, which is simply a useful way to generate sites that don&#8217;t have really advanced features, like e-commerce. But it allows for blindingly fast sites (in fact they load about 4x faster than a WordPress site!) so is a good direction to head in.</p>
<p>Of course if you want a <a href="/wordpress-website-development/">new website for 2018,</a> or just to make sure your existing one <a href="/one-off-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">gets as many visitors as possible,</a> let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all year.</p>

<p>If you read my blog regularly you&#8217;ll know Google in particular takes page speed into account when ranking your website.</p>
<p>But did you know research suggests any page that takes longer than 4 seconds to load starts to lose business? And anything over 7 costs you most of your traffic? Visitors to your site simply hit the back button to get out of there.</p>
<p>Google and Yahoo! both have tools that show you how well your site is performing for speed, and what you can do to improve it. They&#8217;re called Page Speed and Yslow, and you can test them both at once using this tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://gtmetrix.com" target="_blank">http://gtmetrix.com</a></p>
<p>Just put in the URL for your site, and hit go. In a few seconds you&#8217;ll see exactly how well your site is, or isn&#8217;t, doing.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
<p>I recently sat down to improve the speed of bordersundials.co.uk. It was woefully slow, with a 7.4 second initial load time, and &#8220;C&#8221; grades for both Page Speed and Yslow.</p>
<p>After I&#8217;d finished with it, I&#8217;m thrilled to say it&#8217;s loading in 1.84 seconds, with two &#8220;A&#8221; ratings.</p>
<p>As part of this I also suggested the website be moved to my boutique hosting solution, which is configured and tailored to include all kinds of speed extras that regular ISPs turn off.</p>
<p>Test your site, get in touch, and let&#8217;s improve it.</p>

Other search engines aren&#8217;t quite as open about why they rank websites the way they do, but there&#8217;s an excellent chance they measure it as well.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways you can reduce the time it takes your pages to load, and as much as I&#8217;d love to produce one, this is not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p>Just as I did with <a title="Search Engine Optimisation (SEO): Code" href="https://peterwm.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo-code/">the previous entry in this series,</a> I&#8217;ll rely on bullet points to help keep this post useful.</p>
<p>1. Images.<br />
Unsurprisingly, the smaller the file size of your images, the faster they load. As a rule of thumb, any image which is made up of text, line-drawings, or icons is best saved as a PNG. Photos, and realistic images are best saved as JPG.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of other bits of information kept in image files to, called &#8220;meta&#8221; data. Striping that out can be a great way to save a few kilobytes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/" target="_blank">Yahoo Smush.it</a> is a great free tool to help you with this process. I also recommend the use of professional graphic software like Adobe Photoshop, which will show you how various quality settings for images will affect the file size and visual quality.</p>
<p>2. Optimise your code.<br />
You&#8217;d be surprised how many comments, or unnecessary tags get left in live code, be it HTML, PHP, Javascript, CSS, just about anything. Or sometimes code is just written by someone who didn&#8217;t realise there was one function available to do what they wrote in seven. Have someone else take a look at your code to see if you&#8217;ve missed something. Using include files, and lots of CSS, is a good way to keep from having to repeat yourself too.</p>
<p>There are other things like sticking your Javascript at the bottom of your pages if you can, not loading CSS selectors you don&#8217;t use, etc.</p>
<p>3. Minify your code.<br />
Minify tools simply take out all that unnecessary stuff, your comments, line breaks you simply don&#8217;t need, and do all they can to serve as little information to the visitor as possible.</p>
<p>4. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN).<br />
A CDN will store cached versions of your site at various data centres around the world. So when a visitor from New Zealand want to look at your site that&#8217;s located in the UK, it can get most of the files it needs from perhaps Australia, which appear to speed up your site.</p>
<p>There are lots of services to choose from, but for a start <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com" target="_blank">I recommend CloudFlare,</a> not least because it&#8217;s free. Their guff claims it should half the load time of an average website. That&#8217;s a pretty big optimisation right there.</p>
<p>5. Cache<br />
Caching is a key way to speed things up. If you can, use page caching on the server, and browser caching to make sure visitors hold on to local copies of your images, pdfs and other things that don&#8217;t change very often for as long as possible. I&#8217;ll be honest, making caching work for you is pretty technical, even WordPress plugins like W3 Total Cache aren&#8217;t for the feint-of-heart. Caching is really worth doing though, systems like Yahoo!&#8217;s yslow and Google&#8217;s pagespeed that are geared toward showing you ways to improve your site speed (and certainly in Google&#8217;s case, they use your pagespeed results when ranking your site) all have it in their &#8220;very important&#8221; recommendations. Most people will want professional help with this one though.</p>
<p>6. Power!<br />
One of the easiest ways to speed up any site is to improve your server&#8217;s specifications. Adding more RAM, or more processing power nearly always shows a good improvement, and with modern day modular hosting many webhosts can up your specs for you for a few pounds a month. I added an extra 512MB of RAM to the server this site runs on, and it instantly loaded 145% faster. Easy.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot else of course. Pre-loading content, different forms of caching, various web server add-ons etc., but if you start with the six listed above, you&#8217;ll be in good stead.</p>
<p>A word of caution: it&#8217;s all too easy to obsess over your site&#8217;s speed, because it&#8217;s a metric we can get results for really quickly, whereas regular SEO work can take weeks to affect your rankings. But keep your eye on the big picture, and remember, this is part of a larger goal, and absolutely nothing beats quality content in the SEO game.</p>
