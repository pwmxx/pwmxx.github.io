										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You really want to add this to your .htaccess file:</p>
<pre>Redirect 301 / http://your-new-domain</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s break that down.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Redirect&#8221; is pretty obvious, it tells the web server to redirect the request.</li>
<li>&#8220;301&#8221; is a special code that tells any search engines that come by that this change is permanent, and they should update their results to reflect the new URL. (Using &#8220;302&#8221; instead would set it as a temporary move.)</li>
<li>&#8220;/&#8221; just means the entire site, from the very top directory has been moved.</li>
<li>&#8220;http://your-new-domain&#8221; or indeed, <em>whatever your new URL is,</em> is the new domain that all requests should be sent to. Note the final &#8220;/&#8221; on the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy peasy! Now all bookmarks, and search engine results will still be valid and get people to your new address, with one short piece of code.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a slew of methods to speed your site up&#8211;which is not only the polite thing to do for your guests&#8211;but helps with Speed Engine Optimisation (SEO) too. Google in particular looks at how quickly your site loads when deciding how to rank your site in search results.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;re familiar with web servers then everything you need to know is written below. If not, this is the sort of thing you want to have an expert do for you; a faster site is too good an opportunity to pass up.</p>
<p>Browser caching is a process whereby we&#8217;re able to reduce the number of HTTP requests the server needs to process, which reduced page load times. Your server tells the visitor&#8217;s browser not to look for certain files everytime&#8211;usually the file that don&#8217;t change often anyway.</p>
<p>Edit your .htaccess file for your site, and include this code:</p>
<p><code>## EXPIRES CACHING ##<br />
# by Peter Mahoney of peterwm.com<br />
&lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;<br />
ExpiresActive On<br />
ExpiresByType image/jpg "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType image/gif "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType image/png "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType text/css "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType application/pdf "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType text/x-javascript "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType image/x-icon "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresDefault "access 2 days"<br />
&lt;/IfModule&gt;<br />
## EXPIRES CACHING ##</code></p>
<p>Restart your web server, and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<p>Noe this isn&#8217;t all there is to optimising a website for speed. Especially WordPress websites. As you&#8217;ll know by now I&#8217;m a WordPress SEO expert so I really pay a lot of attention to speed. There are plugins, image compression techniques and even extra code snippets worth using.</p>
<p>When it comes to plugin choice for WordPress speed I recommend WP Rocket &#8211; it does a great job out of the box and with just a few setting changes you can really push the envelope. Using that as well as a series of manual image compression techniques I&#8217;m able to improve the average WordPress site&#8217;s speed by 40%!</p>
<p>Speeding things up usually does require a few manual tweaks to code here and there &#8211; it&#8217;s really a job for a professional rather than just trying it yourself (it&#8217;s all too easy to stop a site working properly with this stuff.)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend a faster site enough. For your users, SEO &#8211; hell even the good of the web itself. Let&#8217;s get that content flying.</p>
