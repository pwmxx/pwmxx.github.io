Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;m the first to admit, I struggled with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> at first. Not that it&#8217;s hard to use or anything, in fact it&#8217;s incredibly simple. But I struggled to find its place in my social-media-life.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/peterwm/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve had my profile</a> up there for years, and I&#8217;d fleshed it out (past jobs, current responsibilities, photo, all the things that seemed important) but I wasn&#8217;t interacting with anyone.</p>
<p>All my colleagues and ex-colleagues were on Facebook. LinkedIn let me post messages and share other people&#8217;s updates, but so much less then my other social profiles.</p>
<p>Then I started using it regularly; I just made sure I logged in a couple of times a week. Recommended a couple of people. Wrote to someone I could only find on LinkedIn that I hadn&#8217;t spoken to for a while.</p>
<p>Before I knew it I became a regular. And the more I used it, the more people found me. Job offers, professional queries, community discussions, they&#8217;ve all become an important part of what I do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found even people I do communicate with elsewhere interact differently on LinkedIn. We act in the way we want to present ourselves to our workmates, bosses and clients.</p>
<p>This is the advantage of LinkedIn. Not only can you build your online community, but you can be sure that your interactions on it are going to be framed in a professional manner, and of a higher quality. To this day I&#8217;ve not seen a single photo of a kitten on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t be the first.</p>
