								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-332" title="Peter Mahoney LinkedIn Profile" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/peter_mahoney_linkedin_profile-150x150.png" alt="Peter Mahoney, LinkedIn Profile" width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;m the first to admit, I struggled with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> at first. Not that it&#8217;s hard to use or anything, in fact it&#8217;s incredibly simple. But I struggled to find its place in my social-media-life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my profile up there for years, and I&#8217;d fleshed it out (past jobs, current responsibilities, photo, all the things that seemed important) but I wasn&#8217;t interacting with anyone.</p>
<p>All my colleagues and ex-colleagues were on Facebook. LinkedIn let me post messages and share other people&#8217;s updates, but so much less then my other social profiles.</p>
<p>Then I started using it regularly; I just made sure I logged in a couple of times a week. Recommended a couple of people. Wrote to someone I could only find on LinkedIn that I hadn&#8217;t spoken to for a while.</p>
<p>Before I knew it I became a regular. And the more I used it, the more people found me. Job offers, professional queries, community discussions, they&#8217;ve all become an important part of what I do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found even people I do communicate with elsewhere interact differently on LinkedIn. We act in the way we want to present ourselves to our workmates, bosses and clients.</p>
<p>The first is to post directly to it. In this case you&#8217;re just giving away your content for free to a massive company. They&#8217;ll get the SEO authority for that post, not you. And while you might plan to have a link to your site on the bottom of those posts you give them, links coming out of their website are marked as <em>nofollow,</em> which means they don&#8217;t get used by Google (or other major search engines) as a way of passing on authority.</p>
<p>Oh and of course some folks repost, posting the content on the social network and their own site. Which simply leads to duplicate content issues.</p>
<p>The second method is to just post a link to the article as it appears on your site. So you&#8217;re sharing a link rather than the text. The trouble again is that those links are nofollow, so you won&#8217;t get any SEO juice for it.</p>
<p>But social networks are generally quite protective of their own SEO authority, they&#8217;re not in the business of passing that on to anyone who posts on their platforms. SO I prefer that second option, just link back to your own site. Forget about social networks for SEO. But it&#8217;s still good to interact with people on them, and hopefully those users might follow a link to your <strong>own</strong> site &#8211; then they&#8217;re <em>your</em> audience.</p>
<p>One really positive thing I&#8217;ve noticed about LinkedIn though is it&#8217;s easy to accidentally give them your SEO authority. SEO authority is a way of referring to the search engine kudos, or points you might have. There are traditionally two ways most people publish content on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>This is the advantage of LinkedIn. Not only can you build your online community, but you can be sure that your interactions on it are going to be framed in a professional manner, and of a higher quality. To this day I&#8217;ve not seen a single photo of a kitten on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t be the first.</p>
