										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>On my <a title="Emails about SEO" href="/seo-emails/">SEO Emails section</a> (where I share helpful responses to commonly asked queries) I recently shared a not uncommon occurrence, where a site owner gets the SEO work delivered and then <a title="Website display problems after SEO work" href="/website-display-problems-after-seo-work/">blames the work for causing problems with the front-end of the site.</a></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2736" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-440x315.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="315" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-440x315.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-240x172.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-768x551.jpg 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s actually very rare for that to happen.</strong> On-site SEO has two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>site wide SEO work. For example, default settings for social sharing, sitemaps, robots.txt files, all manner of things.</li>
<li>page specific work. This includes title and description tags, social sharing meta tags, image alt and title tags, things like that.</li>
</ol>
<p>When clients do suggest that SEO has somehow changed their site&#8217;s layout or display, it&#8217;s usually related (to their mind) related to that second part, that certain pages don&#8217;t show like they should, or used to, etc.</p>
<p>But the information output there is all very standard. Title tags are ubiquitous, descriptions, social tags and the like are all just meta content. They live in the head of the page&#8217;s code &#8211; meta head tags of this nature are there to be read by search engines and browsers &#8211; they don&#8217;t impact the display or front-end of the site at all.</p>
<p>And image tags like alt and title tags are added to the code that makes an image display &#8211; it was showing anyway, so again there&#8217;s no change to how the page looks.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on? Why do clients occasionally worry search engine optimisation work has impacted how visitors will see their site?</p>
<p>Quite simply &#8211; and when you think about it this makes perfect sense &#8211; the problem were already there. A lot of website owners don&#8217;t check their site thoroughly regularly. They might just preview new blog posts, or see the homepage fairly often. So they&#8217;re not always going to notice errors.</p>
<p>But after paying an SEO professional for a service as vital as organic search marketing, or indeed paying any web developer for a service, they&#8217;re much more likely to flick through their site to see if anything has happened to it.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when they notice the historical problems.</p>
<p>Fortunately from my perspective as an SEO expert who works in this field full-time there are ways to illustrate that. Google has a recent cache of the last time they scanned a page (so as long as that&#8217;s not been updated in the meantime, it can be used to show the problem existed before any SEO work was done) and the Wayback Machine (from the Internet Archive) can fulfill the same role.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s usually fairly easy to prove.</p>
<p>When I complete an SEO task for a new client I usually get a great big <strong>thank you</strong> in my inbox. But when something like this happens the email will usually be quite accusatory and aggressive, not allowing for the the possibility something else could have caused the problem &#8211; even quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I suppose the moral of the story is quite simple. Website owners, keep an eye on your websites and make sure they work. This is important for a whole host of reasons; I really recommend checking your contact forms work too. My SEO work brings extra visitors (consistently) but if they can&#8217;t get in touch with you because something isn&#8217;t working it&#8217;s a tragedy. And if you do notice a problem be open to a variety of causes and reasons before placing blame. (Quite often problems with sites are caused by updating your theme, plugins, the WordPress core &#8211; those things can even auto-update which means you might not even know there&#8217;s been a change).</p>
<p>From my end of things I&#8217;ll keep doing my best to explain things to anyone with a question, matter-of-factly and politely, knowing full well when someone else is wrong it&#8217;s simply because they didn&#8217;t know something.</p>
<p>And who could blame someone for that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I had a client recently who (for reasons exclusively to do with the inexperience of their website&#8217;s designer) turned off one of the SEO plugins I had installed and configured for them.</h2>
<p><strong>It happened shortly after I carried out an <a title="Wordpress SEO overhaul work" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">initial SEO overhaul</a> on their site, so gives us a valuable insight into the effect of getting SEO done, and the removing it again.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2364" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png" alt="" width="440" height="132" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-240x72.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-768x230.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very small (and brand new company), but you can see the effects in this graph &#8211; taken directly from Google Search Console.</p>
<p>Initially after my work their SEO stats began to shoot up, gaining traction and upward momentum. Immediately after deactivating just one plugin it plummeted back to its original position.</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t use to happen so quickly. If you took SEO work off a site, or just fell behind with updates and changes to best practice, things would trail off over time. It now appears not having the very best SEO at all times leads to an immediate decrease in SEO authority. Because so many website owners (your competitors!) invest in SEO these days it means any time you don&#8217;t have it working, they can rise above you in the rankings.</p>
<p>But other SEO professionals have tried the same thing (turning off a single SEO plugin on their own testing sites) and see the same result. <em>The drop is nearly immediate.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working hard to streamline a bunch of systems, both my internal processes and the packages I sell and offer.</p>
<p>Internally I&#8217;ve made a system that I interact with for my SEO work. Basically I work out the SEO strategy based on the research, then the system creates a file that I import to the site which acts as my starting point for the project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also really made communication more streamlined with a system I created that allows me to rapidly create customised template messages, and also store examples of messages that come up every now and then (but not very often) so I can refer to those the next time I need to send a similar message.</p>
<p>From a selling perspective I&#8217;m very keen to get some really strict packages I can sell to people. Strict in that we both know what&#8217;s involved and I don&#8217;t deviate from them. I all too often become the go to for my clients for bespoke changes even if they&#8217;re not paying for a regular maintenance package. I need to change that to make things easier on myself.</p>
