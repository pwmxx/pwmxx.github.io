<p>Even though it&#8217;s still two days away, I&#8217;m a sucker for a feelgood season, and wanted you to have this electronic card I sent to all my client&#8217;s this week. I really have had a wonderful year, and thank you all for your part in that.</p>

<blockquote><p>We find ourselves at the end of a year. I do hope 2012 has been fantastic for you; filled with success, joy, happinessâ€”and that you&#8217;ve been left with high expectations for the year to come.</p>
<p>Whatever you&#8217;re doing to celebrate this Yuletide, I wish you the very best, and can&#8217;t wait to hear all about it in the new year.</p></blockquote>
