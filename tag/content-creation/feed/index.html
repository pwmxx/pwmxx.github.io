<p><strong>I had an unexpected email interchange with a client a few minutes ago.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d been recommending blogging to him for months. He keeps making excuses why he can&#8217;t; lack of time, what would be write about &#8211; the usual string of things. But I kept pushing because as we all know unique, topical, regular content is great for SEO.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to point out that while I call it <em>blogging</em> really it can be <em>news, updates</em> &#8211; whatever &#8211; just as long as you get well written topical content on your site regularly.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you want from a blog post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unique
<ul>
<li>It needs to be original content to avoid any possibility of a duplicate content issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topical
<ul>
<li>The copy needs to be related to your business. You can&#8217;t just write about your recent holiday if you&#8217;re trying to sell greeting cards. Having said that if you went exploring a variety of greeting card shops while abroad &#8211; that might be enough to make it on topic. (It wouldn&#8217;t be easy to do well though.)</li>
<li>Included in this is it needs to be interesting information, authoritative and useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regular
<ul>
<li>Posting something every week, or even better twice a week, is ideal. Search engines learn to come back and rescan your site for new content often, and it&#8217;s great if there&#8217;s something new for them to index every time. What&#8217;s no good is if you post just a few times a year at fairly random intervals; it&#8217;s better than nothing, but not by much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This client thought he really had me on the issue today when we said he&#8217;d checked with his developer (<em>not</em> another SEO expert, just the person that pieced together his site) and he said not to bother. Because if you search for anything online you&#8217;ll very rarely see a blog post on page one.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s half right. You do rarely see blog posts on page one. But everything else there is wrong.</p>
<p>Just because a blog page might not rank highly on its own merit doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not adding to your overall domain authority. In fact it&#8217;s definitely adding to it. There&#8217;s a reason sites with lots of well written content tend to have homepage&#8217;s that rank more highly than other sites.</p>
<p>If everything in SEO was purely on a page-by-page basis it would be enough to have a single page website that ticked all the boxes and expect it to rank in the top spot. But we all know in industries with any competition that&#8217;s simply not going to happen.</p>
<p>Good content on your site all adds up towards the overall SEO authority of the domain. Those weekly blogs might not be found a lot, but they&#8217;re a large part of the reason your homepage <strong>is.</strong></p>
