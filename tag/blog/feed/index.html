								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>No one should be surprised to hear blogging is good for SEO.</h2>
<p><strong>I had an unexpected email interchange with a client a few minutes ago.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d been recommending blogging to him for months. He keeps making excuses why he can&#8217;t; lack of time, what would be write about &#8211; the usual string of things. But I kept pushing because as we all know unique, topical, regular content is great for SEO.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to point out that while I call it <em>blogging</em> really it can be <em>news, updates</em> &#8211; whatever &#8211; just as long as you get well written topical content on your site regularly.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you want from a blog post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unique
<ul>
<li>It needs to be original content to avoid any possibility of a duplicate content issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topical
<ul>
<li>The copy needs to be related to your business. You can&#8217;t just write about your recent holiday if you&#8217;re trying to sell greeting cards. Having said that if you went exploring a variety of greeting card shops while abroad &#8211; that might be enough to make it on topic. (It wouldn&#8217;t be easy to do well though.)</li>
<li>Included in this is it needs to be interesting information, authoritative and useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regular
<ul>
<li>Posting something every week, or even better twice a week, is ideal. Search engines learn to come back and rescan your site for new content often, and it&#8217;s great if there&#8217;s something new for them to index every time. What&#8217;s no good is if you post just a few times a year at fairly random intervals; it&#8217;s better than nothing, but not by much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This client thought he really had me on the issue today when we said he&#8217;d checked with his developer (<em>not</em> another SEO expert, just the person that pieced together his site) and he said not to bother. Because if you search for anything online you&#8217;ll very rarely see a blog post on page one.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s half right. You do rarely see blog posts on page one. But everything else there is wrong.</p>
<p>Just because a blog page might not rank highly on its own merit doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not adding to your overall domain authority. In fact it&#8217;s definitely adding to it. There&#8217;s a reason sites with lots of well written content tend to have homepage&#8217;s that rank more highly than other sites.</p>
<p>If everything in SEO was purely on a page-by-page basis it would be enough to have a single page website that ticked all the boxes and expect it to rank in the top spot. But we all know in industries with any competition that&#8217;s simply not going to happen.</p>
<p>Good content on your site all adds up towards the overall SEO authority of the domain. Those weekly blogs might not be found a lot, but they&#8217;re a large part of the reason your homepage <strong>is.</strong></p>

Blogging is <strong>the very best</strong> thing you can do for your search engine optimisation. If you are not blogging, you are ignoring the biggest factor in improving your placement in their listings.</p>
<p>Quite simply, if you put all the other tips and tricks aside, the real key to SEO is regular, original content.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really simple. Google et al want to see content written by humans, for humans. So write some.</p>
<p>1. Regular<br />
Search engines work out how often to scan your website and specific pages within that based on how often it has seen those change in the past.</p>
<p>If your pages are all fairly static (meaning there aren&#8217;t any elements on them that change regularly, like text or images) the search giants (Google, Bing, Yahoo!) will stop coming. Google might only index your site every few months.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some massive missed opportunities there. Not only will your site be deemed to have a low Page Rank (not very important in the search results) but even if you do update with some new amazing, original content—it might not be noticed until it&#8217;s well out of date.</p>
<p>2. Original<br />
Search Engines are clever. Google is adept at scanning text and knowing if it&#8217;s the sort of thing a human would read, rather than a bunch of words strung together to try to fool it. They also know very easily if your work is a copy and paste from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Apart from simply making money, search engines all have an ethos behind them. Google for example wants to see a helpful, information rich Internet that answers users&#8217; queries quickly and efficiently. So they rank sites they believe fit into that plan more highly than those that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If your site has too much content pasted from elsewhere, you do not fit into this ideal.</p>
<p>What does is original content. Something <em>you&#8217;ve</em> written (or someone else has written exclusively on your behalf).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as hard as it sounds. Pick a subject that relates to your business. I do this with my blog all the time—and then in your head explain it as you would to one of your customers. Type out your side of the conversation, and you&#8217;re basically done.</p>
<p>3. Keywords<br />
Before you even ask the question, the answer is yes. You do want to target keywords in your blogging. Bear in mind that as long as you&#8217;re writing on topic, they&#8217;ll come out anyway. You want people to find you because of the sort of products and services you offer, so as long as you&#8217;re writing about the subject you sell, they&#8217;ll flow naturally.</p>
<p>Rather than ensuring I type specific words, I do my best to hit a variety of terms.</p>
<p>The sentence you just read is a case in point—it would have seemed normal to use &#8220;words&#8221; in there twice; where I did and then again at the end of the sentence. By using &#8220;terms&#8221; the second time, I&#8217;m improving my SEO because I&#8217;ll be indexed for both &#8220;words&#8221; and &#8220;terms&#8221;, rather than just one of them.</p>
<p>I do this all the time. Synonyms are are important but often overlooked aspect of SEO. A potential client might enter either &#8220;social media&#8221; or &#8220;social networking&#8221; for instance, and if that&#8217;s your industry you want them to find you regardless of the phrase they&#8217;re most familiar with.</p>
<p>Search engine optimisation is all about people—people finding you. Make sure you&#8217;re giving them what they need to do precisely that.</p>

Ideally me of course, but whoever is telling you they&#8217;re an expert really should know how to cover more than the basics.</p>
<p>The number of people I see selling SEO services who really have no idea is appalling. (I&#8217;d say shocking, but there are a lot of opportunists out there!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to break my series of SEO posts into the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Site Speed</li>
<li>Social integration</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Back-links and all other things link oriented</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally there is a lot of cross-over between them, but over the course of the series you&#8217;ll get a better idea of some key concepts, and some fairly original (but proven) ideas for their implementation.</p>
<p>All of course to get you more quality visitors!</p>
