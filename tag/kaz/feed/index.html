								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-205"  title="&quot;i thought you bought 30000 followers on twitter what happen to it&quot; Peter Mahoney"  src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/buy_twitter_followers_online-150x150.png"  alt="&quot;i thought you bought 30000 followers on twitter what happen to it&quot; Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />It&#8217;s true. A couple of months ago <a title="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers" href="https://peterwm.com/i-just-bought-30000-twitter-followers/">I bought 30,000 Twitter followers off ebay,</a> just to see if it was a strategy that was as bad as I expected it to be.</p>
<p>With my sample of one (after all, I&#8217;m the only person I know of who&#8217;s done this) I had, unsurprisingly, mixed results.</p>
<p>On the positive, I did notice I had a much steadier stream of new, legit followers flow in after I did it. I suspect I was right in my thinking that people who looked at my Twitter profile would see I had a lot of followers, and therefore be more inclined to follow me themselves—trusting me as a known opinion leader.</p>
<p>To the negative, I felt dirty. Plain old like I&#8217;d been rolling around in pig filth. Friends and clients would notice and speak to me about how popular I was, and even though I was up-front about what I was doing, I always felt pretty sheepish about it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I was still pretty peeved to receive this tweet from &#8220;Kaz The Masturbator&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/petermahoney">@petermahoney</a> i thought you bought 30000 followers on twitter what happen to it</p>
<p>&mdash; Kaz, The Masturbator (@kazz27) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazz27/statuses/285981378225516544">January 1, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Sure enough, they were gone. About six weeks after I bought them. Of course I can&#8217;t complain, it was sketchy to begin with.</p>
<p>Kaz the oneist was clearly a front, the dodgy seller&#8217;s way of telling me they&#8217;d taken back my purchase.</p>
<p>As an experiment, it was worth undertaking. And I&#8217;ll sum it up like this: I got what I paid for—a lesson. And while I may not be playing alone like Kaz, I&#8217;m certainly 30,000 followers more alone, and happier for it.</p>
