<p>His reply:<br />
&#8220;I focus more on client acquisition instead of the actual work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a problem. If he was only marketing himself as an introductory service or something similar, fine. But he&#8217;s tell his clients he&#8217;s doing to work himself but in fact outsourcing it all, WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE WORK.</p>
<p>So he could be promising his clients all sorts of things without knowing if they&#8217;re possible or even probable.</p>
