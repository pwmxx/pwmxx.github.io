Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />In my family we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule" target="_blank">celebrate Yule</a> just as much as Christmas, it&#8217;s a traditional festival that was absorbed into Christmas when the powers that be picked a date for the latter.</p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s still two days away, I&#8217;m a sucker for a feelgood season, and wanted you to have this electronic card I sent to all my client&#8217;s this week. I really have had a wonderful year, and thank you all for your part in that.</p>

<blockquote><p>We find ourselves at the end of a year. I do hope 2012 has been fantastic for you; filled with success, joy, happinessâ€”and that you&#8217;ve been left with high expectations for the year to come.</p>
<p>Whatever you&#8217;re doing to celebrate this Yuletide, I wish you the very best, and can&#8217;t wait to hear all about it in the new year.</p></blockquote>

Peter Mahoney"  src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/let_it_snow-150x150.png"  alt="Let it snow! Peter Mahoney"  width="150" height="150" />Well, in truth I&#8217;m cold enough here as it is. November 16, and I&#8217;m still fighting the urge to turn the heating on in my office.</p>
<p>My hands are so chilly that I&#8217;m starting to fear for my typing skilsl thgouhg. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I spent the past hour putting some snowflakes on one of my private client&#8217;s WordPress sites, check it out, they look 3D&#8230;and very cool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice little trick that shows people you mean more than just business. It&#8217;s not exactly new, but it&#8217;s the first time they&#8217;ve done it so their online community is in for a treat.</p>
<p>I am going to suggest we replace it with a nice warm fire as we get closer to Yuletide though! And maybe a virtual glass of whiskey to warm our bellies too.</p>
