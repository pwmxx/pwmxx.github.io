<p><strong>Average Position is a bit of a weird metric. Here&#8217;s why.</strong></p>
<p><img  title="Google Search Console &amp; Average Position Explained Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2052" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-440x188.png"  alt="Google Search Console &amp; Average Position Explained Peter Mahoney"  width="440" height="188" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-440x188.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-240x102.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-768x327.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained.png 931w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Consider that graph for a moment. Taken directly from Google Search Console (Google&#8217;s official stats package for organic search &#8211; and my recommendation for the tool you should use to get your ranking and other organic search results) they show two highlighted metrics;</p>
<ul>
<li>Total impressions (in teal) and</li>
<li>Average position (in purple).</li>
</ul>
<p>Impressions is the number of times a site was seen in search results. Average position is the average rank it was seen in.</p>
<p>(Google averages your rank across all impressions as a useful workaround to their personalisation they do when people are searching. Location, how often a user has searched for something before &#8211; there are myriad ways Google skews results. Averaging them out is the best approach to find the most useful ranking to report.)</p>
<p>If you look at the lines on the graph though you&#8217;ll see a number of places where the position appears to get <em>worse </em>right when the impressions become more successful. You&#8217;d think stats should improve hand-in-hand, not get worse as one improves. Right?</p>
<p>In reality, when impressions spikes it&#8217;s <em>normal</em> for the average position to drop. If a site suddenly has a lot more visibility, it usually means it&#8217;s being found for a bunch of terms and searches it wasn&#8217;t previously. A lot of those new terms are likely to be things sort of around the periphery of what the site is about, not just it&#8217;s core purpose. So it&#8217;s being found for a bunch of extra search terms.</p>
<p>The result of that is those new terms probably aren&#8217;t ranking terribly highly. They&#8217;re not the site&#8217;s main purpose, so won&#8217;t be ranking as highly as the normal terms the site has been successful for.</p>
<p><em>Which drags the average rank DOWN.</em></p>
<p>Not only is this good to know when interpreting your own results, but it serves as a reminder that stats aren&#8217;t simply the end of the story, it&#8217;s important to understand how they come about, and what their effect on each other is.</p>
