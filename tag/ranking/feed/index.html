<h2>Searching for yourself is a terrible idea</h2>
<p><strong>I still get asked a lot about discrepancies between what a client sees when they search for themselves, and either the official stats, or what their friend might see, etc.</strong></p>
<p>So this is a refresher about why you shouldn&#8217;t search for yourself as a way to measure your ranking.</p>
<p>Google does all kinds of personalisation on your search results (based on your network&#8217;s IP address, if you&#8217;re logged into any Google accounts, even your location) and the more often you look for your own site, the more skewed those results will be.</p>
<p>To give an example, most people searching for &#8220;peter mahoney&#8221; see my site on the first page. But I see myself on the fourth. Essentially because I&#8217;ve searched for myself so often &#8211; and then not spent much time on my site or even bothered to click it &#8211; Google has &#8220;learnt&#8221; that I don&#8217;t like it and therefore ranks it down for me, uniquely.</p>
<p>The right place to get Google&#8217;s official rank for your site is their own monitoring systems, which is where I get my stats.</p>
<p>Their stats are actually an &#8216;average&#8217; of your rank which is the statistically most useful approach. Because of personalisation, not everyone sees your site in the same position. Where someone is searching from geographically for example has an impact. So the average rank is the best indicator of where you rank.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a commonly held belief that if you use a private browsing window somehow you&#8217;ll see the proper rankings in the search results. But all that does is prevent Google from knowing your account &#8211; they still know where you live, your IP address, in some cases the unique code for your network card &#8211; there&#8217;s *plenty* for them to skew your results with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I noticed a Google UK search for &#8220;peter mahoney&#8221; no longer had me in fourth place. I wasn&#8217;t even on the first page.</p>
<p>Second page, fifth down. This sort of thing is normally an absolute disaster for an SEO expert, the sort of thing that gets them mocked on Twitter and thrown out into the void that exists somewhere between success and scrambling about in the pit of people who pretend they know what they&#8217;re talking about, but really don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very full pit.</p>
<p>But since <em>I&#8217;d done it on purpose,</em> I wasn&#8217;t too worried.</p>
<p>There is so much information online about search engine optimisation (SEO); what works, what doesn&#8217;t, what used to but some people still does, what you get penalised for now that most people haven&#8217;t cottoned on toâ€”basically a lot of misinformation that can harm your ranking.</p>
<p>This site is my sandpit. It&#8217;s where I play with things to find what works, and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I can now confirm:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re best to have you&#8217;re tags on a WordPress site set to &#8220;nofollow&#8221;.</li>
<li>Have categories scanned sparingly, and certainly not by all pages.</li>
<li>Your Twitter feed is better off in your footer than your sidebar (right/left hand column).</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to get my ranking back of course, but not just by undoing all the tests I&#8217;d triedâ€”I applied an optimised set of tweaks I&#8217;ve been working on, and got back the very next time Google spidered my site.</p>

<p>Why is this worth blogging about? Because it&#8217;s free, and the fifth such online tool I found&#8211;but the first one that worked.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t search terribly far into the search engines, so unless you&#8217;re in the top 10 of Google or Bing, or the top 50 of Yahoo!, you won&#8217;t get a result. And clearly you need me to help you out. ðŸ™‚</p>
