					<description><![CDATA[I simply searched the firmware version, bt &#038; wireless. Realised it had to be a wireless issue as I was unable to reach the hub @ http://bthomehub.home/

Strangely, I suffered this problem with 1 mac even though another with identical wireless settings was unaffected, thanks so much!]]></description>

I&#039;m glad it was useful! The sad thing is it&#039;s a year since I posted this, and this issue is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; causing trouble for BT customers.

Come on BT, sort out your Firmware!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perfect! i&#039;ve been struggling for a few hours. I had 2 windows 7 computers on wireless unable to network with each other. firewalls were off but still unable to ping or tracert. as soon as i followed this advice, change from my manually configured channel 6 instantly worked!! 

Thanks. Chris.]]></description>
