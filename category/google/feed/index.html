								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>There are times your SEO results will look like the opposite of what you&#8217;re after.</h2>
<p><strong>Average Position is a bit of a weird metric. Here&#8217;s why.</strong></p>
<p><img  title="Google Search Console &amp; Average Position Explained Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2052" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-440x188.png"  alt="Google Search Console &amp; Average Position Explained Peter Mahoney"  width="440" height="188" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-440x188.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-240x102.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained-768x327.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-search-console-average-position-explained.png 931w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Consider that graph for a moment. Taken directly from Google Search Console (Google&#8217;s official stats package for organic search &#8211; and my recommendation for the tool you should use to get your ranking and other organic search results) they show two highlighted metrics;</p>
<ul>
<li>Total impressions (in teal) and</li>
<li>Average position (in purple).</li>
</ul>
<p>Impressions is the number of times a site was seen in search results. Average position is the average rank it was seen in.</p>
<p>(Google averages your rank across all impressions as a useful workaround to their personalisation they do when people are searching. Location, how often a user has searched for something before &#8211; there are myriad ways Google skews results. Averaging them out is the best approach to find the most useful ranking to report.)</p>
<p>If you look at the lines on the graph though you&#8217;ll see a number of places where the position appears to get <em>worse </em>right when the impressions become more successful. You&#8217;d think stats should improve hand-in-hand, not get worse as one improves. Right?</p>
<p>In reality, when impressions spikes it&#8217;s <em>normal</em> for the average position to drop. If a site suddenly has a lot more visibility, it usually means it&#8217;s being found for a bunch of terms and searches it wasn&#8217;t previously. A lot of those new terms are likely to be things sort of around the periphery of what the site is about, not just it&#8217;s core purpose. So it&#8217;s being found for a bunch of extra search terms.</p>
<p>The result of that is those new terms probably aren&#8217;t ranking terribly highly. They&#8217;re not the site&#8217;s main purpose, so won&#8217;t be ranking as highly as the normal terms the site has been successful for.</p>
<p><em>Which drags the average rank DOWN.</em></p>
<p>Not only is this good to know when interpreting your own results, but it serves as a reminder that stats aren&#8217;t simply the end of the story, it&#8217;s important to understand how they come about, and what their effect on each other is.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My WordPress site is so fast, I’m not even sure I can call it WordPress anymore.</h2>
<p><strong>Static site generators are awesome.</strong></p>
<p>They create blindingly fast sites, with very few drawbacks (more on those later).</p>
<p>But I’ve been using WordPress since it was a small blogging platform call b2. I’m used to it, I like it, and already have a swag of sites built on it for myself; not just my clients.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">I work in SEO</a> speed is really crucial to what I do. I do a lot of caching and optimisation work for people, but wanted to see what would happen if I really pushed the envelope out.</p>
<p>Initially I was keen to make a front-end that pulled data out of a basic WordPress install using JSON. I set up a proof-of-concept successfully, but wasn’t so keen on remaking all my layouts and front-end design from scratch for it. Besides, basic things like the WordPress menu editor, text widgets etc. are something I very much enjoy using.</p>
<p>I did some research, and came across a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP2Static.</a> It’s a slick plugin that basically does just what I wanted – it packages up WordPress sites as static sites you can deploy anywhere. With a bit of configuring you can actually use it to output to a folder on the same server, and use some basic .htaccess rules so that becomes the public facing side of things.</p>
<p>Which is cool, but I wanted to go for MAXIMUM SPEED. My end goal was to get the site hosted on GitHub Pages, and then use Cloudflare to CDN it around the world.</p>
<p>(WP2Static does actually have a system to deploy to GitHub Pages built-in, but I found the deployment process just too slow.)</p>
<p>So when I considered everything I was trying to achieve, which included keeping the live site on the same URL it was already on, I opted to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>move the WordPress install of my site off its current server, onto my localhost machine (it’s fast and I back it up regularly)</li>
<li>use WP2Static to output the site to a local folder</li>
<li>use git via the terminal to publish the site</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, for a nerd, it seems fairly straightforward. And on the whole it worked much more easily than I anticipated. The main glitches to overcome were that a number of font files weren’t being picked up by the plugin for inclusion in the static site. But it has a configuration option to force it to include certain file paths, so that was easily overcome.</p>
<p>I did need to create a manual 404.html page (GitHub Pages looks for that in the top directory of a site) but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>There were a few other tiny things that were really specific to my own WordPress setup – like realising my sitemap.xml file needed to be a flat XML file rather than an index linking to other XML files – because they weren’t going to be wrapped up by the plugin.</p>
<p>The thing you really lose with any static site system though is (logically) user interaction. In my case that was just forms, but I was happy to replace my contact form with a simple email address – anything else I might need in the future I can do by embedding forms directly from another system like Google Forms.</p>
<p>I used to sell a couple of SEO packages directly through my site, but Woocommerce was always overkill for that anyway. In the future I’ll just use a combination of Paypal buttons to replicate the same functionality – and in fact it’ll be simpler for the end user because I don’t need to know all their billing address information to start an SEO job with them.</p>
<p>The really big day-to-day drawback is that clicking ‘Publish’ in WordPress doesn’t publish anything anymore. The process to run a new export with WP2Static and then send it to GitHub Pages takes about two minutes. But considering how often I blog or change anything on the site that’s not a major issue. Like with anything, you need to weigh up the processes, pros and cons against how you actually use something to determine if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>The site I did all this too, fyi, is the one you’re on right now. This is a static site, hosted for free on GitHub Pages and replicated on servers around the world using Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Google PageSpeed Insights gives a 99% speed rating for Desktop. And the missing 1% is simply because I include an external file that I can’t set an expiration header for – ironically that file is the script for Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Pingdom (my preferred speed testing system, because you can choose a server location for the real-world load-time to be tested against – so if your clients are predominantly in London then choose that server to get an idea of the speed as they’ll see it) gives the homepage a 0.212 second loading time. For something ultimately based on WordPress as a content management system, that’s impressive.</p>

<h2>41% of adults search for something using voice at least once a day, and for young adults it&#8217;s over half!</h2>
<p><strong>This applies to Google voice search, Alexa home devices, Siri&#8230;anything you can ask a question and expect a result.</strong></p>
<p>The good news is the way we approach SEO for voice search hasn&#8217;t drastically differed.</p>
<p>Yes, voice searches tend to be longer and more conversational. And direct too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example, let&#8217;s say I want to know what the highest mountain is in the UK. Previously I might have entered <em>highest mountain uk</em> into a search engine.</p>
<p>But when asking a voice assistant, I&#8217;m more likely to say something along the lines of tell me <em>what is the highest mountain in the uk. </em>So it&#8217;s longer and more conversational. But despite its length it <strong>is</strong> more direct; I&#8217;m being clearer about what I want to know, which is what the highest one is.</p>
<p>That text search could bring up a page of results that list several high mountains, or articles that talk about a recent event or news story that took place on the highest mountain.</p>
<p>At this point in time search engines are taking these voice questions and dumbing them down for their own purposes. So when a voice search tool is actually working out what results to return, the example above could well be turned into that simpler 3-word version behind the scenes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really going to have an impact is when that directness starts to be factored in a lot more intuitively. Because at that point in time search will become less like looking up relevant information based on a subject (like an old encyclopedia) and more to do with answering really specific questions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very early days to think about how the approach we take to SEO might change when that happens. But the key will be in line with the major engines&#8217; existing ethos &#8211; your website should have a clear purpose, and be written in a natural human readable way so that visitors can easily find the information they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>And in that regard voice search is really just a continuation of the direction the search engines have been heading toward for well over a decade.</p>

<h2>Searching for yourself is a terrible idea</h2>
<p><strong>I still get asked a lot about discrepancies between what a client sees when they search for themselves, and either the official stats, or what their friend might see, etc.</strong></p>
<p>So this is a refresher about why you shouldn&#8217;t search for yourself as a way to measure your ranking.</p>
<p>Google does all kinds of personalisation on your search results (based on your network&#8217;s IP address, if you&#8217;re logged into any Google accounts, even your location) and the more often you look for your own site, the more skewed those results will be.</p>
<p>To give an example, most people searching for &#8220;peter mahoney&#8221; see my site on the first page. But I see myself on the fourth. Essentially because I&#8217;ve searched for myself so often &#8211; and then not spent much time on my site or even bothered to click it &#8211; Google has &#8220;learnt&#8221; that I don&#8217;t like it and therefore ranks it down for me, uniquely.</p>
<p>The right place to get Google&#8217;s official rank for your site is their own monitoring systems, which is where I get my stats.</p>
<p>Their stats are actually an &#8216;average&#8217; of your rank which is the statistically most useful approach. Because of personalisation, not everyone sees your site in the same position. Where someone is searching from geographically for example has an impact. So the average rank is the best indicator of where you rank.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a commonly held belief that if you use a private browsing window somehow you&#8217;ll see the proper rankings in the search results. But all that does is prevent Google from knowing your account &#8211; they still know where you live, your IP address, in some cases the unique code for your network card &#8211; there&#8217;s *plenty* for them to skew your results with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

<p>Over the past week I&#8217;ve seen more than my fair share of emails from Google regarding &#8220;<span class="il">Nonsecure</span> Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56&#8243;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big change, but not exactly a surprising one.</p>
<p>Google has been pushing to make the web more secure for a long time. Seeing HTTPS and green padlocks all over the web has been a key direction for them &#8211; they&#8217;ve even given secure sites a ranking boost as part of their algorithms. This new change is really an extension of their general SEO ethos.</p>
<p>So anyone running the latest version of Google&#8217;s Chrome Browser (version 56) will see a warning when browsing any web page that asks for sensitive information. The examples they&#8217;ve given are passwords or credit card details but undoubtedly there&#8217;s other situations a user would be presented with a warning too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been recommending web owners migrate to HTTPS for a few years, but now it&#8217;s become really important especially if you have any page users can log in through (including I expect WordPress Dashboard login pages like wp-login.php) or e-commerce.</p>
<p>These things may well be frustrating when they first crop up, requiring immediate changes to your website. But bear in mind Google has been open about their general desires for the web (that it be easy to find useful information, that it be secure, mobile friendly and fast) for a long time. So as long as you apply those same concepts to your own site as soon as you can then changes like this will actually put you ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>In case you know this impacts you but haven&#8217;t yet had the email from Google about it (or don&#8217;t use Google Search Console in which case you&#8217;d never get one) here is the text of their message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonsecure Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56 for http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>To: owner of http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>Beginning in January 2017, Chrome (version 56 and later) will mark pages that collect passwords or credit card details as “Not Secure” unless the pages are served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>The following URLs include input fields for passwords or credit card details that will trigger the new Chrome warning. Review these examples to see where these warnings will appear, and so you can take action to help protect users’ data. The list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>{examples are given here}</p>
<p>The new warning is the first stage of a long-term plan to mark all pages served over the non-encrypted HTTP protocol as “Not Secure”.</p></blockquote>

<p>Google Apps (used for business email, file sharing, calendaring etc.) is now rebranded as G Suite.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a bad mid-90s R&amp;B group. (Try as I might, I can&#8217;t forget &#8220;Rappin&#8217; 4-Tay&#8221;.)*</p>
<p>In their official blog post, Google said this is more in keeping more with their mission to provide a series of tools businesses use to further their own purposes. Basically rather than a series of individual applications coming together they see it as a stock set of tools within one Google system.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Google Apps proved to be an invaluable tools for companies, schools and universities, and I do hope G Suite continues to build on and improve those systems.</p>
<p>But I do have one niggling concern in the back of my mind. Google Apps used to be free for small firms, then overnight all new accounts were subject to a subscription fee. Existing free accounts continued to run with charge &#8211; but any change to Apps brings a fear they might start to charge for those grandfathered accounts.</p>
<p>And with a change this big, well &#8211; Google Apps keep free accounts, but will G Suite?</p>

<p>Well they&#8217;ve really increased this as a search signal – sites that are NOT mobile friendly will now have a very hard time competing with those that are.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also updated <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">their mobile friendliness test</a> to make it more restrictive—it&#8217;s worth retesting your sites to make sure they still pass. Of course the best test is always the information displayed within Google Search Console which reports on the entire site, not just one page at a time.</p>
<p>The extra good news for those of you with mobile responsive sites is that any of your competitors who do not have mobile friendly sites will now suffer in their rankings.</p>
<p>One related point, there is a growing body of data that suggests this change also affects (in a smaller capacity) sites from normal desktops – that Google is prioritising sites that are mobile friendly on searches from ALL devices.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t confirmed that yet, so it&#8217;s not certain, but I am keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a responsive site for mobile devices yet and you don&#8217;t want to get caught out, <a href="https://peterwm.com/contact/">please contact me</a> and I can help make you a new, fully mobile complaint one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m often asked about how to change the description Google shows in their search results. (This post applies in part to many search engines, but Google in particular.)</p>
<p><img  title="Google descriptions Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1698" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/google-search-results-descriptions-440x99.png"  alt="Google descriptions Peter Mahoney"  width="440" height="99" />The answer is slightly more complicated than any of us might like. The old response (going back a decade or more) was to just change your meta description tag. Those used to be picked up verbatim.</p>
<p>But these days Google isn&#8217;t beholden to anything we provide (with the exception perhaps of your own domain name). They can pick and choose what they think will be most useful to their users. They don&#8217;t have to use the description we provide&#8211;they can choose to ignore it and create their own.</p>
<div>If we want to give our descriptions the best possible chance of being picked up, they need to conform to the following:</div>
<ul>
<li>be between 150-159 characters*</li>
<li>be in sentence structure</li>
<li>not include too many commas or ands &#8211; basically avoid things that make it look like it could be a list of keywords</li>
<li>ideally, it would be a whole sentence or two taken directly from the text of the page</li>
<li>in fact, really ideally it would be the first sentence or two from the page</li>
</ul>
<p>and on top of all that of course it needs to fit our own needs of being informative and enticing people to visit the site.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>* = Normally 130-160 (or some other variant within that range, but usually ending with 160) is touted as acceptable. Recent data suggests in fact 160 may be too long, many pages with 160 characters exactly are finding their descriptions are being truncated before the last word with a ellipses (&#8230;) added, making it look unfinished. So 159 seems the current practical maximum.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote a post about backlinks. But it&#8217;s always worth re-iterating this.</p>
<p>In short, my stance on these has only become stronger, because Google has become even more clever.</p>
<p>The shortest answer to the backlink question is that having backlinks is very beneficial.</p>
<p>But the longer answer is actually more important. Google has become incredibly adept at working out which backlinks are natural (i.e., someone liked your site and linked to it) as opposed to bought, meaning you paid for them.</p>
<p>Natural backlinks help your SEO, generally speaking. As for manipulated ones, once Google realises what you&#8217;ve done (which can take a few months) they will usually hurt your rank, often quite drastically.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people selling what they called &#8220;safe&#8221; links, or &#8220;Google friendly links&#8221;. In truth Google is very clear that any attempt to buy or create links is contrary to their ethos and something they will try to find and penalise you for.</p>
<p>And they are very good at it.</p>
<p>The reason people still sell them is a quirk of Google&#8217;s algorithm. When Google first see new links come in for a site they will <em>almost</em> always improve that sites ranking. It&#8217;s not until they&#8217;ve seen the patterns emerge and they realise they were faked links that they penalise you.</p>
<p>So when someone first buys links they usually do see an improvement, and feel happy with the service that made them. Months later when their site takes a hit&mdash;it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>So, are backlinks good? Absolutely. Should you try to have them created on your behalf? Absolutely not.</p>
