A couple of months ago <a title="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers" href="https://peterwm.com/i-just-bought-30000-twitter-followers/">I bought 30,000 Twitter followers off ebay,</a> just to see if it was a strategy that was as bad as I expected it to be.<p>With my sample of one (after all, I’m the only person I know of who’s done this) I had, unsurprisingly, mixed results.</p><p>On the positive, I did notice I had a much steadier stream of new, legit followers flow in after I did it. I suspect I was right in my thinking that people who looked at my Twitter profile would see I had a lot of followers, and therefore be more inclined to follow me themselves—trusting me as a known opinion leader.</p><p>To the negative, I felt dirty. Plain old like I’d been rolling around in pig filth. Friends and clients would notice and speak to me about how popular I was, and even though I was up-front about what I was doing, I always felt pretty sheepish about it.</p><p>Nonetheless, I was still pretty peeved to receive this tweet from “Kaz The Masturbator”:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/petermahoney">@petermahoney</a> i thought you bought 30000 followers on twitter what happen to it</p><p>— Kaz, The Masturbator (@kazz27) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazz27/statuses/285981378225516544">January 1, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Sure enough, they were gone. About six weeks after I bought them. Of course I can’t complain, it was sketchy to begin with.</p><p>Kaz the oneist was clearly a front, the dodgy seller’s way of telling me they’d taken back my purchase.</p><p>As an experiment, it was worth undertaking. And I’ll sum it up like this: I got what I paid for—a lesson. And while I may not be playing alone like Kaz, I’m certainly 30,000 followers more alone, and happier for it.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/hints-and-tips/" rel="category tag">Hints & Tips</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/social-networking/" rel="category tag">Social networking</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/tweets/" rel="category tag">Tweets</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/barnyard-animals/" rel="tag">barnyard animals</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/cheating/" rel="tag">cheating</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/experiment/" rel="tag">experiment</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/followers/" rel="tag">followers</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/kaz/" rel="tag">kaz</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/masturbation/" rel="tag">masturbation</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/pig/" rel="tag">pig</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/sheep/" rel="tag">sheep</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/twitter/" rel="tag">Twitter</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-423 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-content-2 category-opinion category-social-networking tag-arsenal tag-commentary tag-facebook-2 tag-instagram tag-social-media tag-twitter tag-warren-ellis entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/warren-ellis-and-peter-mahoney-on-social-media/">Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2013-01-15T12:39:43+00:00">January 15, 2013</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-428" title="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150" data-lazy-src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warren-ellis-150x150.jpg"></p><noscript><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-428" title="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warren-ellis-150x150.jpg" alt="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150"></noscript>Warren Ellis, English author and social commentator, wrote a wonderful post shortly before Christmas in which he discussed the end of the first wave of social media.<blockquote><p>Twitter alters its terms of access to its information, thereby harming the services that built themselves on that information. Which was stupid, because Twitter gets fewer and fewer material benefits from allowing people to use its water. And why would you build a service that relies on a private company’s assets anyway? Facebook changes its terms of access regularly. It’s broken its own Pages system and steadily grows more invasive and desperate. Instagram, now owned by Facebook, just went through its first major change in terms of service. Which went as badly as anyone who’s interacted with Facebook would expect. As Twitter disconnected itself from sharing services like IFTTT, so Instagram disconnected itself from Twitter. Flickr’s experiencing what will probably be a brief renaissance due to having finally built a decent iOS app, but its owners, Yahoo!, are expert in stealing defeat from the jaws of victory. Tumblr seems to me to be spiking in popularity, which coincides neatly with their hiring an advertising sales director away from Groupon, a company described by Techcrunch last year as basically loansharking by any other name.</p><p>This may be the end of the cycle that began with Friendster and Livejournal. Not the end of social media, by any means, obviously. But it feels like this is the point at where the current systems seize up for a bit. Perhaps not even in ways that most people will notice. But social media seems now to be clearly calcifying into Big Media, with Big Media problems like cable-style carriage disputes. Frame the Twitter-Instagram spat in terms of Virginmedia not being able to carry Sky Atlantic in the UK, say (I know there are many more US examples).</p></blockquote><p>This first wave, or cycle as he calls it, can best be described as one of ecstatic enthusiasm bordering on insanity.</p><p>His closing statement wonders if anyone regrets giving up their own websites in favour of just using social platforms yet. I bet the answer is yes, and I’ve been warning people against that for a long time. More on that another day though.</p><p>To focus on the core message of the piece—yes, he’s right. People have been so far up social media’s behind that they forgot to try to turn the lights on to check where they were.</p><p>And just where are they? At the mercy of a bunch or other companies who have very right (although very little market-mandate) to change their terms of service and take what you thought was yours.</p><p>Issues of content ownership and the like aside though, I’ve been waiting for this bubble to burst for a long while—because it’s time to simply accept social media, rather than jumping up and down on the sofa about it.</p><p>Is social media exciting? Of course. New technology, ways to reach your audience and methods of interaction always are. But they aren’t the be-all and end-all. Television still has exciting content. Radio programs can still blow my mind.</p><p>Once all the hype settles down, content becomes the clarifying point, sorting the overly excited from the thoughtful.</p><p>When approaching social media for any business purpose, look at it in the context of all your online work, sites, portfolios, information, etc. If you just think outside the box a little bit, you can have a very large and well rounded arsenal of online communications at your disposal. Which can all work together to improve your bottom line.</p><p>I’ve been waiting for a long time for people to realise that as exciting and useful as social media is, it’s one tool you have at your disposal, and you have many. Make them all work together, for you.</p><p>Think of it like this, there will always be new waves. And just watching them from the beach is no good, you need to ride them. But stay on top of them where you can see what’s happening around you, rather than falling in and finding you’ve crashed up on a beach with no David Hasselhoff in sight.</p><p>via <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=14546">Warren Ellis » The Social Web: End Of The First Cycle</a>.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/content-2/" rel="category tag">Content</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/opinion/" rel="category tag">Opinion</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/social-networking/" rel="category tag">Social networking</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/arsenal/" rel="tag">arsenal</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/commentary/" rel="tag">commentary</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/facebook-2/" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/instagram/" rel="tag">instagram</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/social-media/" rel="tag">social media</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/twitter/" rel="tag">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/warren-ellis/" rel="tag">warren ellis</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-390 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-social-networking entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/a-point-well-made/">A point well made!</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2012-12-24T09:10:15+00:00">December 24, 2012</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>It’s time we stopped feeling and acting so entitled.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-394" title="A point well made!

Not that it’s hard to use or anything, in fact it’s incredibly simple. But I struggled to find its place in my social-media-life.<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/peterwm/" target="_blank">I’ve had my profile</a> up there for years, and I’d fleshed it out (past jobs, current responsibilities, photo, all the things that seemed important) but I wasn’t interacting with anyone.</p><p>All my colleagues and ex-colleagues were on Facebook. LinkedIn let me post messages and share other people’s updates, but so much less then my other social profiles.</p><p>Then I started using it regularly; I just made sure I logged in a couple of times a week. Recommended a couple of people. Wrote to someone I could only find on LinkedIn that I hadn’t spoken to for a while.</p><p>Before I knew it I became a regular. And the more I used it, the more people found me. Job offers, professional queries, community discussions, they’ve all become an important part of what I do.</p><p>I’ve found even people I do communicate with elsewhere interact differently on LinkedIn.

After all, ritual permeates all of what we do. I even brush my teeth in a certain way that has become ritualistic. (Start on the lower left, scrubbing around the bottom before moving to the top).</p><p>Ritual can, at it’s most basic, be defined as:</p><p><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ritual" target="_blank"><strong>5. </strong><strong>a. </strong> A detailed method of procedure faithfully or regularly followed</a></p><p>That for me is it’s most basic meaning. I love ritual as an experience, something that can be shared, and transformative.</p><p>And that is the highest ideal of any online community, to help individuals change through participation in a shared group experience. The online medium of course is very different to a religious or secular ceremony, but it’s differences afford people the option to engage in a different way, to play out other parts of themselves, which is turn allows for a completely different transformation.</p><p>That’s my thought of the day. It’s amazing the train of thoughts a simple Wikipedia search can inspire.</p><p>Anyway, I’ve brushed my teeth, now on to work.</p><p>via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community">Online community – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/online-community-2/" rel="category tag">Online community</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/opinion/" rel="category tag">Opinion</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/social-networking/" rel="category tag">Social networking</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/communitiy/" rel="tag">communitiy</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/dictionary/" rel="tag">dictionary</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/online/" rel="tag">online</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/online-communities/" rel="tag">online communities</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/online-community/" rel="tag">online community</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/ritual/" rel="tag">ritual</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/transformative/" rel="tag">transformative</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-204 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-online-community-2 category-opinion category-social-networking tag-buy-followers tag-dishonest tag-ebay tag-experiment tag-twitter entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/i-just-bought-30000-twitter-followers/">I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2012-11-08T11:29:04+00:00">November 8, 2012</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-205" title="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150" data-lazy-src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/buy_twitter_followers_online-150x150.png"></p><noscript><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-205" title="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/buy_twitter_followers_online-150x150.png" alt="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150"></noscript>I’m breaking my own rules, so you don’t have to.<p>I maintain, and always have, that quality is the key component to any online community.
