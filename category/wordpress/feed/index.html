								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually do resolutions or anything like that, but as this site is now a few years old it makes sense to resolve to make myself a new one.</p>
<p>It might take a bit longer than usual because I&#8217;ll be doing it all with a &#8220;static site generator&#8221;, which is simply a useful way to generate sites that don&#8217;t have really advanced features, like e-commerce. But it allows for blindingly fast sites (in fact they load about 4x faster than a WordPress site!) so is a good direction to head in.</p>
<p>Of course if you want a <a href="/wordpress-website-development/">new website for 2018,</a> or just to make sure your existing one <a href="/one-off-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">gets as many visitors as possible,</a> let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all year.</p>

<p>Over the past week I&#8217;ve seen more than my fair share of emails from Google regarding &#8220;<span class="il">Nonsecure</span> Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56&#8243;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big change, but not exactly a surprising one.</p>
<p>Google has been pushing to make the web more secure for a long time. Seeing HTTPS and green padlocks all over the web has been a key direction for them &#8211; they&#8217;ve even given secure sites a ranking boost as part of their algorithms. This new change is really an extension of their general SEO ethos.</p>
<p>So anyone running the latest version of Google&#8217;s Chrome Browser (version 56) will see a warning when browsing any web page that asks for sensitive information. The examples they&#8217;ve given are passwords or credit card details but undoubtedly there&#8217;s other situations a user would be presented with a warning too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been recommending web owners migrate to HTTPS for a few years, but now it&#8217;s become really important especially if you have any page users can log in through (including I expect WordPress Dashboard login pages like wp-login.php) or e-commerce.</p>
<p>These things may well be frustrating when they first crop up, requiring immediate changes to your website. But bear in mind Google has been open about their general desires for the web (that it be easy to find useful information, that it be secure, mobile friendly and fast) for a long time. So as long as you apply those same concepts to your own site as soon as you can then changes like this will actually put you ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>In case you know this impacts you but haven&#8217;t yet had the email from Google about it (or don&#8217;t use Google Search Console in which case you&#8217;d never get one) here is the text of their message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonsecure Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56 for http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>To: owner of http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>Beginning in January 2017, Chrome (version 56 and later) will mark pages that collect passwords or credit card details as “Not Secure” unless the pages are served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>The following URLs include input fields for passwords or credit card details that will trigger the new Chrome warning. Review these examples to see where these warnings will appear, and so you can take action to help protect users’ data. The list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>{examples are given here}</p>
<p>The new warning is the first stage of a long-term plan to mark all pages served over the non-encrypted HTTP protocol as “Not Secure”.</p></blockquote>

You&#8217;ve made your WordPress site, launched it, then noticed all the empty comment sections and wondered where they came from.</p>
<p>Commenting in WordPress is turned on by default.</p>
<p>To switch it off, got to:<br />
Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Discussion</p>
<p>and untick:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles</li>
<li>Allow people to post comments on new articles</li>
</ul>
<p>That sorts out all your future posts and pages. But what about the ones you&#8217;ve already published?</p>
<p>For all current posts you have to do each manually. The easiest way is to go to:<br />
Dashboard &gt; Poststhen click &#8220;Quick Edit&#8221; under them one by one, and unticking these options:<br />
<img  title="Turning off comments in Wordpress Peter Mahoney" class="size-full wp-image-1721 alignnone" src="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-from-2016-07-27-10-30-50.png"  alt="Turning off comments in Wordpress Peter Mahoney"  width="255" height="70" srcset="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-from-2016-07-27-10-30-50.png 255w, http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-from-2016-07-27-10-30-50-240x66.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></p>
<p>Being sure to &#8220;Update&#8221; after each one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a faff, especially if you&#8217;ve already published a lot of content. But a learning experience nonetheless.</p>
<p>Comments on this post are (incidentally) open.</p>

<p>Well they&#8217;ve really increased this as a search signal – sites that are NOT mobile friendly will now have a very hard time competing with those that are.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also updated <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">their mobile friendliness test</a> to make it more restrictive—it&#8217;s worth retesting your sites to make sure they still pass. Of course the best test is always the information displayed within Google Search Console which reports on the entire site, not just one page at a time.</p>
<p>The extra good news for those of you with mobile responsive sites is that any of your competitors who do not have mobile friendly sites will now suffer in their rankings.</p>
<p>One related point, there is a growing body of data that suggests this change also affects (in a smaller capacity) sites from normal desktops – that Google is prioritising sites that are mobile friendly on searches from ALL devices.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t confirmed that yet, so it&#8217;s not certain, but I am keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a responsive site for mobile devices yet and you don&#8217;t want to get caught out, <a href="http://pwmxx.github.io/contact/">please contact me</a> and I can help make you a new, fully mobile complaint one.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing website development since 1995, and SEO since 1998. Even according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwell-explains-the-10000-hour-rule-2014-6?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s 10,000 hour</a> rule, that makes me an expert in both areas a few times over.</p>
<p>I just had a moment this morning that reminded myself just how experienced I am what I do. One client signed up for my <a href="http://pwmxx.github.io/monthly-wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">monthly SEO service</a> a few weeks ago. Normally it&#8217;s a month before I issue the first update but I do like to keep an eye on how things are going and check the data fairly regularly.</p>
<p>So when he wrote to ask how things were progressing I was very happy to be able to send him this graph, showing the number of times his site was seen in Google search results over the past 90 days, with a crudely drawn arrow indicating when he started working with me.</p>
<p><img  title="How good am I? Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1651" src="http://pwmxx.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/great-monhtly-seo-440x134.png"  alt="How good am I?

<p>So how good am I? Very good. I&#8217;m just not always very good at telling you about it.</p>

This is such a project!</p>
<p>David Burnett from Image Control Photography wanted an update for his site, which was based on a very well-known (but it turns out not cross-browser compatible) WordPress theme. He works in the hotly contested wedding photography market, and needed to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I made one myself that is a lot more dependable than the one he bought off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m more of a red and black person and the colour scheme might not be to my personal tastes—but everything is well laid out, easy to read, fully responsive (even on Windows Mobile IE) and has a good mix of high quality photography with text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have a glass of wine to celebrate this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://imagecontrolphotography.co.uk/" target="_blank">imagecontrolphotography.co.uk</a></p>

So if you find any references in the site to &#8220;photogr<strong>pa</strong>hy&#8221;, that&#8217;s entirely my fault.</p>

There&#8217;s a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation out there.</p>
<p>When search engines first came out (pre-Google), the idea that they could read a whole website was out of reach. It would take too long, require they store too much data, and generally there needed to be a quick, simple approach to scanning a website. The simplest of the simplest techniques was &#8220;meta keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>This was a small piece of code that lived behind the scenes of a site, that listed all the keywords a site owner wanted their site to rank with. The list was delineated by a comma, so looked something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;meta name=&#8221;keywords&#8221; content=&#8221;SEO, search engine optimisation, WordPress&#8221; /&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>This method was open to huge amounts of abuse on the part of a website owner. There was nothing stopping someone using keywords which were known to rank well, but didn&#8217;t even appear in their website. We started seeing tens of thousands of search results which were really a bait and switch, and it was eroding from the quality of the internet.</p>
<p>Google came along, and was one of the first search engines to really have a strong ethos behind it, in that they wanted to find a way to keep the internet useful, and digitally clean &amp; tidy.</p>
<p>The solution was to index every site&#8217;s entire contents, scanning all the text that a real human could actually read, and working out based on sentence structure, density of nouns etc what a website was really about.</p>
<p>The next step was to start overlooking the meta keyword tag entirely.</p>
<p>And that was about a decade ago. Other major search engines followed suit, and as a result that list of keywords has been defunct and totally ignored for the best part of a decade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for a host of reasons (many SEO &#8220;experts&#8221; don&#8217;t actually keep ahead of best practice, or are too happy to just do whatever their clients ask without explaining the process, or just that keyword lists entered the collectively consciousness at a formative time in the internet&#8217;s history) people still think they&#8217;re going to be useful.</p>
<p>One of the most popular SEO plugins for WordPress actually says next to the &#8220;Use keywords?&#8221; field, &#8220;I can&#8217;t think why you&#8217;d want to know. The search engines don&#8217;t&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sadly a lot of people get caught up on these, and their focus disappears from what is important to something that absolutely is not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not helped by the number of places that lists of words and phrases ARE still used, like Google Adsense for example. We also track our website&#8217;s analytics based on what search queries people found us with, etc.</p>
<p>I prefer to call these things &#8220;search terms&#8221;, or occasionally &#8220;key terms&#8221;. I try to steer clear of the (possible) synonym &#8220;keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what I do in this regard is to look at your site as Google et al try to, (pretty well) as a human being. I read your site to see what it&#8217;s really about. I then run tests just like they do to see what words and phrases you use most often, and check that those do a good job of describing what your site is actually about. Most of the time, as long as someone has written their website from their own knowledge and experience of their industry or topic, these match just fine.</p>
<p>Occasionally I find someone thinks they have a site about, say, &#8220;window fitting&#8221;, but really it comes across as being about &#8220;buy my product&#8221;. You can imagine how that might happen, but it&#8217;s not want the search companies want to see so it&#8217;s not what we want to give them.</p>
<p>If I come across a discrepancy like that, I let my clients know that they need to rethink their content asap.</p>
<p>As long as they do match, I make sure I reinforce those terms everywhere we know Google et al want to see them. In image tags, in the description tag, in the page titles.</p>
<p>So, the short answer to a long history is let me take care of that&#8211;if I need to alert you to an issue I&#8217;ll let you know, and please don&#8217;t be surprised if you look at your site&#8217;s code when I&#8217;ve done and there is no outdated &#8220;keywords&#8221; code.</p>

<p>If you read my blog regularly you&#8217;ll know Google in particular takes page speed into account when ranking your website.</p>
<p>But did you know research suggests any page that takes longer than 4 seconds to load starts to lose business? And anything over 7 costs you most of your traffic? Visitors to your site simply hit the back button to get out of there.</p>
<p>Google and Yahoo! both have tools that show you how well your site is performing for speed, and what you can do to improve it. They&#8217;re called Page Speed and Yslow, and you can test them both at once using this tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://gtmetrix.com" target="_blank">http://gtmetrix.com</a></p>
<p>Just put in the URL for your site, and hit go. In a few seconds you&#8217;ll see exactly how well your site is, or isn&#8217;t, doing.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
<p>I recently sat down to improve the speed of bordersundials.co.uk. It was woefully slow, with a 7.4 second initial load time, and &#8220;C&#8221; grades for both Page Speed and Yslow.</p>
<p>After I&#8217;d finished with it, I&#8217;m thrilled to say it&#8217;s loading in 1.84 seconds, with two &#8220;A&#8221; ratings.</p>
<p>As part of this I also suggested the website be moved to my boutique hosting solution, which is configured and tailored to include all kinds of speed extras that regular ISPs turn off.</p>
<p>Test your site, get in touch, and let&#8217;s improve it.</p>
