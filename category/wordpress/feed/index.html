								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The correct approach to image tags may surprise you. Here&#8217;s a reminder about why they are best optimised using a plugin.</p>
<p>Because of the way WordPress evolved over time from a simple blogging tool to an advanced content management system, traditionally people have set alt &amp; title tags per image, using the media manager.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not best for SEO. Images should reinforce what the <strong>page</strong> is about, not <em>just</em> what the image is of.</p>
<p>To give an example, if you have one image that&#8217;s used on two pages, you might not want them to both have the same alt tags. So the systems I set up does an excellent job of setting those tags in the live code whenever a page is visited. It mixes the page title with the name of your site to make sure both your branding and (most importantly) what the page is actually about is being reinforced.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best approach for image tags and search engines.</p>
<p>(My favourite plugin for this is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pb-seo-friendly-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PB SEO Friendly Images.)</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Far too many WordPress sites end up with empty social links</h2>
<p>I see this all the time; in the header or footer of WordPress sites, a series of little social media icons that links to &#8211; nothing.</p>
<p>A lot of WordPress themes have sections for you to fill out your social profiles, so those little buttons can link to them correctly. But a lot of those themes will show them regardless of whether or not you&#8217;ve entered proper URLs. Some go a step further, and by default will have a link entered as <em>#.</em> That just means it links back to the page you&#8217;re on, but it&#8217;s enough to get the buttons showing and essentially linking to nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy enough oversight to make. But it means you have dead links which isn&#8217;t great for your SEO, and if visitors notice then it just seems wildly unprofessional.</p>
<p>If you have social buttons, they really need to link to social sites. It&#8217;s not hard to do &#8211; these sorts of WordPress themes are intended to make everything as simple as possible &#8211; but at the very least have a quick check of your own site and make sure your social button links, well, <em>link.</em></p>
<p>In all honesty I see this in perhaps a third of WordPress sites overall, so there&#8217;s a good chance it affects your&#8217;s.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually do resolutions or anything like that, but as this site is now a few years old it makes sense to resolve to make myself a new one.</p>
<p>It might take a bit longer than usual because I&#8217;ll be doing it all with a &#8220;static site generator&#8221;, which is simply a useful way to generate sites that don&#8217;t have really advanced features, like e-commerce. But it allows for blindingly fast sites (in fact they load about 4x faster than a WordPress site!) so is a good direction to head in.</p>
<p>Of course if you want a <a href="/wordpress-website-development/">new website for 2018,</a> or just to make sure your existing one <a href="/one-off-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">gets as many visitors as possible,</a> let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all year.</p>

<p>Over the past week I&#8217;ve seen more than my fair share of emails from Google regarding &#8220;<span class="il">Nonsecure</span> Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56&#8243;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big change, but not exactly a surprising one.</p>
<p>Google has been pushing to make the web more secure for a long time. Seeing HTTPS and green padlocks all over the web has been a key direction for them &#8211; they&#8217;ve even given secure sites a ranking boost as part of their algorithms. This new change is really an extension of their general SEO ethos.</p>
<p>So anyone running the latest version of Google&#8217;s Chrome Browser (version 56) will see a warning when browsing any web page that asks for sensitive information. The examples they&#8217;ve given are passwords or credit card details but undoubtedly there&#8217;s other situations a user would be presented with a warning too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been recommending web owners migrate to HTTPS for a few years, but now it&#8217;s become really important especially if you have any page users can log in through (including I expect WordPress Dashboard login pages like wp-login.php) or e-commerce.</p>
<p>These things may well be frustrating when they first crop up, requiring immediate changes to your website. But bear in mind Google has been open about their general desires for the web (that it be easy to find useful information, that it be secure, mobile friendly and fast) for a long time. So as long as you apply those same concepts to your own site as soon as you can then changes like this will actually put you ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>In case you know this impacts you but haven&#8217;t yet had the email from Google about it (or don&#8217;t use Google Search Console in which case you&#8217;d never get one) here is the text of their message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonsecure Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56 for http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>To: owner of http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>Beginning in January 2017, Chrome (version 56 and later) will mark pages that collect passwords or credit card details as “Not Secure” unless the pages are served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>The following URLs include input fields for passwords or credit card details that will trigger the new Chrome warning. Review these examples to see where these warnings will appear, and so you can take action to help protect users’ data. The list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>{examples are given here}</p>
<p>The new warning is the first stage of a long-term plan to mark all pages served over the non-encrypted HTTP protocol as “Not Secure”.</p></blockquote>

You&#8217;ve made your WordPress site, launched it, then noticed all the empty comment sections and wondered where they came from.</p>
<p>Commenting in WordPress is turned on by default.</p>
<p>To switch it off, got to:<br />
Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Discussion</p>
<p>and untick:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles</li>
<li>Allow people to post comments on new articles</li>
</ul>
<p>That sorts out all your future posts and pages. But what about the ones you&#8217;ve already published?</p>
<p>For all current posts you have to do each manually. The easiest way is to go to:<br />
Dashboard &gt; Poststhen click &#8220;Quick Edit&#8221; under them one by one, and unticking these options:<br />

<p>Being sure to &#8220;Update&#8221; after each one.</p>

<p>Well they&#8217;ve really increased this as a search signal – sites that are NOT mobile friendly will now have a very hard time competing with those that are.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also updated <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">their mobile friendliness test</a> to make it more restrictive—it&#8217;s worth retesting your sites to make sure they still pass. Of course the best test is always the information displayed within Google Search Console which reports on the entire site, not just one page at a time.</p>
<p>The extra good news for those of you with mobile responsive sites is that any of your competitors who do not have mobile friendly sites will now suffer in their rankings.</p>
<p>One related point, there is a growing body of data that suggests this change also affects (in a smaller capacity) sites from normal desktops – that Google is prioritising sites that are mobile friendly on searches from ALL devices.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t confirmed that yet, so it&#8217;s not certain, but I am keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a responsive site for mobile devices yet and you don&#8217;t want to get caught out, <a href="https://peterwm.com/contact/">please contact me</a> and I can help make you a new, fully mobile complaint one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not very good at tooting my own horn, but for the record, there are over 1,000 reviews of my service floating around on the internet, an 998 of those are 5-star feedbacks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing website development since 1995, and SEO since 1998. Even according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwell-explains-the-10000-hour-rule-2014-6?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s 10,000 hour</a> rule, that makes me an expert in both areas a few times over.</p>
<p>I just had a moment this morning that reminded myself just how experienced I am what I do. One client signed up for my <a href="https://peterwm.com/monthly-wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">monthly SEO service</a> a few weeks ago. Normally it&#8217;s a month before I issue the first update but I do like to keep an eye on how things are going and check the data fairly regularly.</p>
<p>So when he wrote to ask how things were progressing I was very happy to be able to send him this graph, showing the number of times his site was seen in Google search results over the past 90 days, with a crudely drawn arrow indicating when he started working with me.</p>
<p><img  title="How good am I? Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1651" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/great-monhtly-seo-440x134.png"  alt="How good am I?

<p>So how good am I? Very good. I&#8217;m just not always very good at telling you about it.</p>

This is such a project!</p>
<p>David Burnett from Image Control Photography wanted an update for his site, which was based on a very well-known (but it turns out not cross-browser compatible) WordPress theme. He works in the hotly contested wedding photography market, and needed to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I made one myself that is a lot more dependable than the one he bought off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m more of a red and black person and the colour scheme might not be to my personal tastes—but everything is well laid out, easy to read, fully responsive (even on Windows Mobile IE) and has a good mix of high quality photography with text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have a glass of wine to celebrate this one.</p>

So if you find any references in the site to &#8220;photogr<strong>pa</strong>hy&#8221;, that&#8217;s entirely my fault.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s updated to be fully responsive and looks great on portable devices like mobiles and tablets, and I like to think it&#8217;s well laid out and easy to use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually been up for a few days as a trial, and within 24 hours I had a compliment from someone who had just come across my site for the first time, and said they found it easy to use and navigate.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>(Oh yes, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t add that I can make you a site just as awesome—<a title="Contact" href="https://peterwm.com/contact/">ask me how.)</a></p>
