1. Increase speed, reports tell me it&#8217;s slow<br />
2. SEO audit &amp; recommendations<br />
3. SEO optimisation</p>
<p>I think 2 &amp; 3 are covered in your offer here. Can you also help with 1?<br />
I think I already have most of the set up bit in place (site map, SEO pack etc).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>I have a few thoughts around this&#8230;</p>
<p>1)<br />
I don&#8217;t do speed work by itself anymore &#8211; only bundled with SEO. I can probably make the site faster &#8211; I usually achieve around an 35-40% increase in loading time (I can&#8217;t make promises of course!) but because your iste currently loads in around 6 seconds that&#8217;s still not going to be terribly fast.</p>
<p>You can see from the attached benchmark in the &#8216;File Requests&#8217; graph towards the bottom that the thing taking most of the loading time is actually just the very first &#8216;connection&#8217; bit. That suggests it could be a problem with the server causing the slowdown, not the site, which I wouldn&#8217;t be able to resolve for you.</p>
<p>2)<br />
Your SEO could do with an overhaul to be honest. Just looking at something as basic as the homepage description it&#8217;s already breaking one of the main rules &#8211; it has too many commas. Too many of those and Google assume you&#8217;re just keyword stuffing. Which to be fair is what you&#8217;re doing here.</p>
<p>So I can certainly overhaul your SEO, and look to improve the loading time as part of the job with the add-on.</p>
<p>Up to you obviously! Thanks again,</p>

<p>Thanks for contacting me. It&#8217;s always good to be recommended!</p>
<p>My offer would be appropriate for your site: you don&#8217;t have a lot of SEO work on there currently so it would certainly make a difference.</p>
<p>A few general thoughts:</p>
<p>1)<br />
Your homepage is a bit light on text. Personally I&#8217;d recommend you rewrite the main About page text (to ensure it&#8217;s unique) and include that on the homepage too. If that isn&#8217;t feasible I&#8217;d suggest moving the main About page text to the homepage instead.</p>
<p>2)<br />
It&#8217;s good you have active social media accounts. They can work well for social related traffic to your site (when you link from them to pages on the site) but actually have very little SEO impact. Facebook for example has marked all their outbound links as &#8216;nofollow&#8217; for some years. So links don&#8217;t count towards your SEO authority. In my experience social accounts are best used to create a mini &#8216;community&#8217; on those platforms you can have your own specific strategies for.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
