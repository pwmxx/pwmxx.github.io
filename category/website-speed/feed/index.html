										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>We&#8217;ve known for a long time that how fast your site loads is important for SEO.</h2>
<p><strong>Google have <em>increased</em> the importance of your website&#8217;s mobile speed when working out where to rank it.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been true for a while that there&#8217;s been some small impact on your ranking based on mobile speed (desktop speed has been important for years) but now that&#8217;s been ramped up.</p>
<p>The most important metrics they use remain the sort of SEO work I do in the code and the quality of your content &#8211; but when those things are being looked after mobile speed is where you should turn your attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the automated tests out there tend to be a bit alarmist <a href="https://peterwm.com/problems-with-google-pagespeed-insights/">(I blogged about that recently)</a> but they can still serve as a reminder that there&#8217;s nearly always room for improvement.</p>
<p>WordPress certainly has its issues with speed. And most themes are still being built for desktop-first (meaning how it looks on a desktop computer is the primary concern, and then it&#8217;s cut down and limited for mobile) when in fact current standards are clear that mobile-first should be the designers focus.</p>
<p>Be aware that although the testing systems are imperfect, and WordPress is very hard to score upwards of 80% with on most systems &#8211; the faster your site is the better.</p>
<p>In fact, mobile speed is now more important than desktop speed as a ranking metric for Google.</p>
<p>As a general piece of advice, my favourite tool for testing a site&#8217;s overall speed (not mobile specific) is <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pingdom.</a></p>
<p>They give you a list of different servers to choose from; so it&#8217;s easier to get a real-world figure for your loading time in seconds &#8211; just like your target market will see it. Choose the nearest server to your primary audience, et voila.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My WordPress site is so fast, I’m not even sure I can call it WordPress anymore.</h2>
<p><strong>Static site generators are awesome.</strong></p>
<p>They create blindingly fast sites, with very few drawbacks (more on those later).</p>
<p>But I’ve been using WordPress since it was a small blogging platform call b2. I’m used to it, I like it, and already have a swag of sites built on it for myself; not just my clients.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">I work in SEO</a> speed is really crucial to what I do. I do a lot of caching and optimisation work for people, but wanted to see what would happen if I really pushed the envelope out.</p>
<p>Initially I was keen to make a front-end that pulled data out of a basic WordPress install using JSON. I set up a proof-of-concept successfully, but wasn’t so keen on remaking all my layouts and front-end design from scratch for it. Besides, basic things like the WordPress menu editor, text widgets etc. are something I very much enjoy using.</p>
<p>I did some research, and came across a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP2Static.</a> It’s a slick plugin that basically does just what I wanted – it packages up WordPress sites as static sites you can deploy anywhere. With a bit of configuring you can actually use it to output to a folder on the same server, and use some basic .htaccess rules so that becomes the public facing side of things.</p>
<p>Which is cool, but I wanted to go for MAXIMUM SPEED. My end goal was to get the site hosted on GitHub Pages, and then use Cloudflare to CDN it around the world.</p>
<p>(WP2Static does actually have a system to deploy to GitHub Pages built-in, but I found the deployment process just too slow.)</p>
<p>So when I considered everything I was trying to achieve, which included keeping the live site on the same URL it was already on, I opted to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>move the WordPress install of my site off its current server, onto my localhost machine (it’s fast and I back it up regularly)</li>
<li>use WP2Static to output the site to a local folder</li>
<li>use git via the terminal to publish the site</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, for a nerd, it seems fairly straightforward. And on the whole it worked much more easily than I anticipated. The main glitches to overcome were that a number of font files weren’t being picked up by the plugin for inclusion in the static site. But it has a configuration option to force it to include certain file paths, so that was easily overcome.</p>
<p>I did need to create a manual 404.html page (GitHub Pages looks for that in the top directory of a site) but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>There were a few other tiny things that were really specific to my own WordPress setup – like realising my sitemap.xml file needed to be a flat XML file rather than an index linking to other XML files – because they weren’t going to be wrapped up by the plugin.</p>
<p>The thing you really lose with any static site system though is (logically) user interaction. In my case that was just forms, but I was happy to replace my contact form with a simple email address – anything else I might need in the future I can do by embedding forms directly from another system like Google Forms.</p>
<p>I used to sell a couple of SEO packages directly through my site, but Woocommerce was always overkill for that anyway. In the future I’ll just use a combination of Paypal buttons to replicate the same functionality – and in fact it’ll be simpler for the end user because I don’t need to know all their billing address information to start an SEO job with them.</p>
<p>The really big day-to-day drawback is that clicking ‘Publish’ in WordPress doesn’t publish anything anymore. The process to run a new export with WP2Static and then send it to GitHub Pages takes about two minutes. But considering how often I blog or change anything on the site that’s not a major issue. Like with anything, you need to weigh up the processes, pros and cons against how you actually use something to determine if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>The site I did all this too, fyi, is the one you’re on right now. This is a static site, hosted for free on GitHub Pages and replicated on servers around the world using Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Google PageSpeed Insights gives a 99% speed rating for Desktop. And the missing 1% is simply because I include an external file that I can’t set an expiration header for – ironically that file is the script for Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Pingdom (my preferred speed testing system, because you can choose a server location for the real-world load-time to be tested against – so if your clients are predominantly in London then choose that server to get an idea of the speed as they’ll see it) gives the homepage a 0.212 second loading time. For something ultimately based on WordPress as a content management system, that’s impressive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a slew of methods to speed your site up&#8211;which is not only the polite thing to do for your guests&#8211;but helps with Speed Engine Optimisation (SEO) too. Google in particular looks at how quickly your site loads when deciding how to rank your site in search results.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;re familiar with web servers then everything you need to know is written below. If not, this is the sort of thing you want to have an expert do for you; a faster site is too good an opportunity to pass up.</p>
<p>Browser caching is a process whereby we&#8217;re able to reduce the number of HTTP requests the server needs to process, which reduced page load times. Your server tells the visitor&#8217;s browser not to look for certain files everytime&#8211;usually the file that don&#8217;t change often anyway.</p>
<p>Edit your .htaccess file for your site, and include this code:</p>
<p><code>## EXPIRES CACHING ##<br />
# by Peter Mahoney of peterwm.com<br />
&lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;<br />
ExpiresActive On<br />
ExpiresByType image/jpg "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType image/gif "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType image/png "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresByType text/css "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType application/pdf "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType text/x-javascript "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash "access 1 month"<br />
ExpiresByType image/x-icon "access 1 year"<br />
ExpiresDefault "access 2 days"<br />
&lt;/IfModule&gt;<br />
## EXPIRES CACHING ##</code></p>
<p>Restart your web server, and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<p>Noe this isn&#8217;t all there is to optimising a website for speed. Especially WordPress websites. As you&#8217;ll know by now I&#8217;m a WordPress SEO expert so I really pay a lot of attention to speed. There are plugins, image compression techniques and even extra code snippets worth using.</p>
<p>When it comes to plugin choice for WordPress speed I recommend WP Rocket &#8211; it does a great job out of the box and with just a few setting changes you can really push the envelope. Using that as well as a series of manual image compression techniques I&#8217;m able to improve the average WordPress site&#8217;s speed by 40%!</p>
<p>Speeding things up usually does require a few manual tweaks to code here and there &#8211; it&#8217;s really a job for a professional rather than just trying it yourself (it&#8217;s all too easy to stop a site working properly with this stuff.)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend a faster site enough. For your users, SEO &#8211; hell even the good of the web itself. Let&#8217;s get that content flying.</p>
