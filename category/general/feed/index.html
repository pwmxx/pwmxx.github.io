<p>One company was charging Â£400 a month, for six months, and supposedly never noticed that the robots.txt file was blocking all search engines from visiting.</p>
<p>Another set up a CNAME redirect for a site&#8211;and naturally Google was marking everything as duplicate content!</p>
<p>I wish this industry had fewer cowboys.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first started working for myself I needed a confidence boost, and sitting in my office asking people if they needed help with anything wasn&#8217;t giving me it.</p>
<p>I had a tonne of offers for agency work, but I&#8217;m in this game to create my own business, not just support someone else&#8217;s. I&#8217;m happy to be a gun for hire, but I want to at least be protecting my own town.</p>
<p>A friend recommended PeoplePerHour, and at first I was somewhat sceptical because of other similar freelance sites I&#8217;d used (that all seemed very driven to support the buyer, making the seller feel like a turd begging for work) but got my first paying job on it within several hours. Then another. Then a third.</p>
<p>That was the confidence I needed. Next thing I knew I was taking on client&#8217;s from elsewhere, and could demonstrate my skills.</p>
<p>I came back though. I wanted to start 2013 with some fresh work, so you&#8217;ll find me selling my wares there again. It&#8217;s a creative space for people to meet and find common ground to work towards. ANd of course, there&#8217;s some really talented developers on there too.</p>
<p>If I do say so myself.</p>
<p>Why not hire me?</p>
