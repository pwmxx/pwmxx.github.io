<p>There&#8217;s a new force in Digital Marketing in New Zealand &#8211; which I may have more than a little to do with.</p>
<p>As an ex-New Zealander I still like to keep myself appraised of what&#8217;s going on down there, and have decided to throw my hat in their digital marketing ring. People who have worked with me before will know I work a little differently:</p>
<p><em>No nonsense, up front pricing, and everything delivered on time and on budget.</em></p>
<p>And every market needs a company like that!</p>
<p>🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://pwm.nz">Purple Web Marketing in NZ</a> is a new company I&#8217;ll be overseeing, but it&#8217;s a team effort rather than just myself. I&#8217;ve been using contractors to help out as the business has grown, but it&#8217;s time to call a spade a spade and say it&#8217;s a proper agency.</p>
<p>The UK business will be brought up to speed as well in the next few weeks, becoming the UK headquarters for Purple Web Marketing. So make the most of this black website while you can &#8211; it&#8217;s all going very purple very soon.</p>
<p>I remember at high school a guidance counselor once promised that &#8220;one day, we&#8217;ll all be working remotely from anywhere in the world!&#8221; and I&#8217;m pleased to say she was right. You&#8217;ll find me all over the place, working hard and delivering great results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past week I&#8217;ve seen more than my fair share of emails from Google regarding &#8220;<span class="il">Nonsecure</span> Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56&#8243;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big change, but not exactly a surprising one.</p>
<p>Google has been pushing to make the web more secure for a long time. Seeing HTTPS and green padlocks all over the web has been a key direction for them &#8211; they&#8217;ve even given secure sites a ranking boost as part of their algorithms. This new change is really an extension of their general SEO ethos.</p>
<p>So anyone running the latest version of Google&#8217;s Chrome Browser (version 56) will see a warning when browsing any web page that asks for sensitive information. The examples they&#8217;ve given are passwords or credit card details but undoubtedly there&#8217;s other situations a user would be presented with a warning too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been recommending web owners migrate to HTTPS for a few years, but now it&#8217;s become really important especially if you have any page users can log in through (including I expect WordPress Dashboard login pages like wp-login.php) or e-commerce.</p>
<p>These things may well be frustrating when they first crop up, requiring immediate changes to your website. But bear in mind Google has been open about their general desires for the web (that it be easy to find useful information, that it be secure, mobile friendly and fast) for a long time. So as long as you apply those same concepts to your own site as soon as you can then changes like this will actually put you ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>In case you know this impacts you but haven&#8217;t yet had the email from Google about it (or don&#8217;t use Google Search Console in which case you&#8217;d never get one) here is the text of their message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonsecure Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56 for http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>To: owner of http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>Beginning in January 2017, Chrome (version 56 and later) will mark pages that collect passwords or credit card details as “Not Secure” unless the pages are served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>The following URLs include input fields for passwords or credit card details that will trigger the new Chrome warning. Review these examples to see where these warnings will appear, and so you can take action to help protect users’ data. The list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>{examples are given here}</p>
<p>The new warning is the first stage of a long-term plan to mark all pages served over the non-encrypted HTTP protocol as “Not Secure”.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img  title="SEO&#039;s walking dead, and their house of cards Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1487" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/house-of-cards-440x150.jpg"  alt="SEO&#039;s walking dead, and their house of cards Peter Mahoney"  width="440" height="150" />I read an article this morning which shared Gale Ann&#8217;s view on Internet piracy (she&#8217;s the producer of a popular TV show called The Walking Dead) .</p>
<p>However, this post isn&#8217;t commenting on piracy as a topic, rather Ann&#8217;s own comment that a Google search for Netflix&#8217;s House of Cards (another very popular TV program) doesn&#8217;t even bring up the official site in the top 50 results.</p>
<p>On the surface, she&#8217;s saying &#8220;look at all the piracy sites that come before the proper one!&#8221;, but behind that is the idea that by default, the official site for anything should come top. The problem is, <strong>Netflix&#8217;s site for House of Cards has terrible SEO,</strong> that&#8217;s why it performs so poorly.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not nearly enough textual content, and the meta tags are actually about Netflix, not the show, and therefore they score very poorly for relevancy (how many words in the tags also appear on the page) which is likely to have them penalised by Google, not shoved higher up the rankings.</p>
<p>This serves as an excellent cautionary tale. Just because you feel you deserve to be in the top spot, doesn&#8217;t mean you will be. If other people are writing about your industry, product or service, and do it better than you do—they will beat you in the rankings.</p>
<p>If you care about your position, <a title="WordPress SEO" href="https://peterwm.com/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">invest in some proper, industry-leading SEO</a>—and get where you want to be.</p>

<p>As part of the process I&#8217;ve dropped my &#8220;Welcome&#8221; link, which went back to the homepage. Users can still return there by clicking the main site title—but I&#8217;m interested to see what happens if I &#8220;squeeze&#8221; my menu to just the most important bits.</p>

This is such a project!</p>
<p>David Burnett from Image Control Photography wanted an update for his site, which was based on a very well-known (but it turns out not cross-browser compatible) WordPress theme. He works in the hotly contested wedding photography market, and needed to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I made one myself that is a lot more dependable than the one he bought off-the-shelf.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&#8217;m more of a red and black person and the colour scheme might not be to my personal tastes—but everything is well laid out, easy to read, fully responsive (even on Windows Mobile IE) and has a good mix of high quality photography with text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have a glass of wine to celebrate this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://imagecontrolphotography.co.uk/" target="_blank">imagecontrolphotography.co.uk</a></p>
<p><img  title="New site: Essex Wedding Photographers Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1400"  alt="New site: Essex Wedding Photographers Peter Mahoney"  src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-440x585.jpg" width="440" height="585" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-440x585.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers-180x240.jpg 180w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Image-Control-Wedding-Photography-Essex-Photographers.jpg 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" />PS, Dave, my one confession is for some reason, the way I type doesn&#8217;t allow me to ever spell &#8220;photography&#8221; correctly. So if you find any references in the site to &#8220;photogr<strong>pa</strong>hy&#8221;, that&#8217;s entirely my fault.</p>

<p>The answer is number two. 2! I&#8217;ve been first for months, and now there&#8217;s a pesky LinkedIn directory above me.</p>
<p>My first thought was, &#8220;But I haven&#8217;t changed anything!&#8221; and of course, that&#8217;s the problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only blogged a few times in the past four months. I used to keep a regular schedule of three times a week, and Google loved me for it. It got their SEO juices flowing. But now, I&#8217;m falling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic in one way (and not in the Alanis sense, but something that actually fits the definition of irony) in that I write to at least two clients a day extolling the virtues of blogging. I&#8217;ve been so busy preaching the blogging gospel that I haven&#8217;t had the time to do it myself.</p>
<p>Well, all that changes today. Thrice a week, you&#8217;ll see me writing. And you&#8217;ll see me back at number one as a result of those efforts.</p>
<p>And I won&#8217;t feel like such a hypocrite when delivering my sermons.</p>
