										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>On my <a title="Emails about SEO" href="/seo-emails/">SEO Emails section</a> (where I share helpful responses to commonly asked queries) I recently shared a not uncommon occurrence, where a site owner gets the SEO work delivered and then <a title="Website display problems after SEO work" href="/website-display-problems-after-seo-work/">blames the work for causing problems with the front-end of the site.</a></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2736" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-440x315.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="315" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-440x315.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-240x172.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site-768x551.jpg 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SEO-broken-site.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s actually very rare for that to happen.</strong> On-site SEO has two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>site wide SEO work. For example, default settings for social sharing, sitemaps, robots.txt files, all manner of things.</li>
<li>page specific work. This includes title and description tags, social sharing meta tags, image alt and title tags, things like that.</li>
</ol>
<p>When clients do suggest that SEO has somehow changed their site&#8217;s layout or display, it&#8217;s usually related (to their mind) related to that second part, that certain pages don&#8217;t show like they should, or used to, etc.</p>
<p>But the information output there is all very standard. Title tags are ubiquitous, descriptions, social tags and the like are all just meta content. They live in the head of the page&#8217;s code &#8211; meta head tags of this nature are there to be read by search engines and browsers &#8211; they don&#8217;t impact the display or front-end of the site at all.</p>
<p>And image tags like alt and title tags are added to the code that makes an image display &#8211; it was showing anyway, so again there&#8217;s no change to how the page looks.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on? Why do clients occasionally worry search engine optimisation work has impacted how visitors will see their site?</p>
<p>Quite simply &#8211; and when you think about it this makes perfect sense &#8211; the problem were already there. A lot of website owners don&#8217;t check their site thoroughly regularly. They might just preview new blog posts, or see the homepage fairly often. So they&#8217;re not always going to notice errors.</p>
<p>But after paying an SEO professional for a service as vital as organic search marketing, or indeed paying any web developer for a service, they&#8217;re much more likely to flick through their site to see if anything has happened to it.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when they notice the historical problems.</p>
<p>Fortunately from my perspective as an SEO expert who works in this field full-time there are ways to illustrate that. Google has a recent cache of the last time they scanned a page (so as long as that&#8217;s not been updated in the meantime, it can be used to show the problem existed before any SEO work was done) and the Wayback Machine (from the Internet Archive) can fulfill the same role.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s usually fairly easy to prove.</p>
<p>When I complete an SEO task for a new client I usually get a great big <strong>thank you</strong> in my inbox. But when something like this happens the email will usually be quite accusatory and aggressive, not allowing for the the possibility something else could have caused the problem &#8211; even quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I suppose the moral of the story is quite simple. Website owners, keep an eye on your websites and make sure they work. This is important for a whole host of reasons; I really recommend checking your contact forms work too. My SEO work brings extra visitors (consistently) but if they can&#8217;t get in touch with you because something isn&#8217;t working it&#8217;s a tragedy. And if you do notice a problem be open to a variety of causes and reasons before placing blame. (Quite often problems with sites are caused by updating your theme, plugins, the WordPress core &#8211; those things can even auto-update which means you might not even know there&#8217;s been a change).</p>
<p>From my end of things I&#8217;ll keep doing my best to explain things to anyone with a question, matter-of-factly and politely, knowing full well when someone else is wrong it&#8217;s simply because they didn&#8217;t know something.</p>
<p>And who could blame someone for that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Right, this is an interesting one. It&#8217;s technical, but has a very simple main recommendation (in large text, below).</em></p>
<h2>Google has started to include something they&#8217;re calling CLS in their ranking metrics.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2747" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cls-scale-202001-440x128.png" alt="" width="440" height="128" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cls-scale-202001-440x128.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cls-scale-202001-240x70.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cls-scale-202001-768x223.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cls-scale-202001.png 930w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p><strong>Essentially it means &#8216;how long before elements loading on the site stop moving around&#8217;, and their target is just 0.25 seconds.</strong></p>
<p>If things move around as your page loads for longer than that it&#8217;ll get a warning in their system. (This isn&#8217;t general loading time, just a very specific part of how a site loads.)</p>
<p>Think about when a website loads, the first thing it does is load the layout &#8211; where the menu is, where images will go, text, etc. That&#8217;s the elements they&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine for a image to take longer to load, as long as the space it will take is already reserved for it when it DOES load. To be honest most of this happens so quickly you can&#8217;t even see it.</p>
<p>But there is one <strong>very</strong> common thing lots of sites have turned on that means layout changes happen <em>long</em> after a page is loaded &#8211; and that&#8217;s &#8220;lazy load&#8221; for images.</p>
<p>Lazy Load was a great technique when it became popular a decade ago. It meant images didn&#8217;t load on a page until the browser needed to se them. If an image was at the bottom of a page, and the user wouldn&#8217;t see it in the browser until they scrolled down, it waited until it needed to load it to do so.</p>
<p>But when that happens, it moves elements on the page around accordingly to make space for the image &#8211; and therefore will always fail the CLS test Google does for all sites and pages.</p>
<p>So ironically something that used to be recommended to help a page load faster is now a problem for passing loading time tests!</p>
<p>Personally I&#8217;ve not used Lazy load for years (in most cases it was unclear if the speed enhancement it brought was actually better than the extra Javascript it needed to work) &#8211; but now my recommendation to all website owners is clear:</p>
<h3>If you use Lazy Load, turn it off.</h3>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2744" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/google-algorithm-update-winners-losers-440x244.png" alt="" width="440" height="244" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/google-algorithm-update-winners-losers-440x244.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/google-algorithm-update-winners-losers-240x133.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/google-algorithm-update-winners-losers-768x426.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/google-algorithm-update-winners-losers.png 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p><strong>Bulk analysis of tens of thousands of sites has revealed which industries were affected for the better, and which for the worse.</strong></p>
<p>This is how Google tends to treat these larger core updates &#8211; rather than just looking for smaller changes to SEO settings, punctuation, word use, etc. &#8211; they&#8217;re actively trying to impact entire industries and sectors.</p>
<p>Industries that saw a strong, positive effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounting &amp; Taxes</li>
<li>Arts &amp; Entertainment</li>
<li>Business Services</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Food &amp; Drink</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Health Conditions</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Law &amp; Government</li>
<li>Nutrition &amp; Fitness</li>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Relocation &amp; Moving</li>
<li>Science &amp; Education</li>
</ul>
<p>While industries they&#8217;ve slightly downgraded include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addictions</li>
<li>Dating</li>
<li>Natural &amp; Alternative Medicine</li>
<li>News &amp; Media</li>
<li>Performing Arts</li>
<li>Senior Care</li>
<li>Sports</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, downgrading an entire industry doesn&#8217;t always have the effect you&#8217;d initially expect. So yes, <em>addiction services</em> might have been downgraded, but that impacts everyone in that sector. So anyone searching for &#8216;addiction recovery hotline&#8217; for example will still be competing with other sites in the same situation.</p>
<p>The main takeaways for SEO professionals here is that there are more industries in the positive list, and that this is the widest reaching change they&#8217;ve made for some time.</p>
<p>One industry to watch in particular is <em>Natural &amp; Alternative Medicine,</em> which Google has been after for a while. The last few large-scale algorithm updates from Google have really targeted this sector. And fair enough, scientific information has never been more important than it is in the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But having said that I personally have had a lot of success with the couple of clients I have who fall into this sector, over the past six months their organic SEO stats have more than doubled. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I had a client recently who (for reasons exclusively to do with the inexperience of their website&#8217;s designer) turned off one of the SEO plugins I had installed and configured for them.</h2>
<p><strong>It happened shortly after I carried out an <a title="Wordpress SEO overhaul work" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">initial SEO overhaul</a> on their site, so gives us a valuable insight into the effect of getting SEO done, and the removing it again.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2364" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png" alt="" width="440" height="132" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-240x72.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-768x230.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very small (and brand new company), but you can see the effects in this graph &#8211; taken directly from Google Search Console.</p>
<p>Initially after my work their SEO stats began to shoot up, gaining traction and upward momentum. Immediately after deactivating just one plugin it plummeted back to its original position.</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t use to happen so quickly. If you took SEO work off a site, or just fell behind with updates and changes to best practice, things would trail off over time. It now appears not having the very best SEO at all times leads to an immediate decrease in SEO authority. Because so many website owners (your competitors!) invest in SEO these days it means any time you don&#8217;t have it working, they can rise above you in the rankings.</p>
<p>But other SEO professionals have tried the same thing (turning off a single SEO plugin on their own testing sites) and see the same result. <em>The drop is nearly immediate.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Using FAQs on your site to get extra traffic from search results</h2>
<p><strong>Google loves a good Q&amp;A, and they&#8217;re great for your search engine optimisation.</strong></p>
<p>This is an excellent technique that Google has been responding to very positively recently. It involves a fairly interesting type of structured data.</p>
<p>Structured data is a series of tags and what&#8217;s known as <em>microdata</em> that Google, Bing and Yahoo all use to work out what content on your site matches specific, common types of information like phone numbers. It primarily sits in your pages&#8217; code &#8211; it&#8217;s not something the user sees directly. Although in the case of FAQs you do want them to be able to see them as well &#8211; that way your front-end information matches what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes. Google definitely wants to see that the information you&#8217;re supplying <em>them</em> is also what you&#8217;re giving to your <em>users.</em></p>
<p>You may have noticed little &#8216;People also ask&#8217; <em>click-to-open</em> sections like this on Google results pages before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2297 alignnone" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png" alt="" width="440" height="316" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-240x173.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation.png 658w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Those questions and answers are being pulled from web pages with &#8216;FAQ&#8217; structured data on their homepages.</p>
<p>This technique involves adding an FAQ section to your own homepage, and then having the appropriate code added to those so Google can pick them up correctly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried this with a handful of clients and most have seen a 3-4 ranking place increase as a result! Even if Google doesn&#8217;t end up using your FAQs on their results page, the effect is the same; they just like to see the code in place.</p>
<p>So this is well worth implementing as part of your SEO strategy.</p>
<p>When writing FAQs for this purpose though it&#8217;s best to make them somewhat generic &#8211; they should be about your industry generally rather than about your specific offering. (If you take a look at the ones I wrote <a href="https://peterwm.com/">on my own homepage,</a> you&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re <em>predominantly</em> about SEO and it&#8217;s advantages rather than being about the services I offer myself.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like me to implement this for you <a href="mailto:peter@webcraft.email">please just get in touch</a> &#8211; and of course I can do it all for you as part of <a href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">an ongoing SEO campaign too.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>SEO is SEO, but when you&#8217;re advertising the different forms of English can get in the way.</h2>
<p><strong>I work with people all around the world, but there&#8217;s quite a bit more to achieving that than you might think.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to sell services around the world from the comfort of your own office is fantastic. But for those of us with geographically ambiguous spellings it raises a few issues.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2109" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I speak (and write) <em>British English</em> &#8211; or as we like to call it, just <em>English. </em>So naturally I list my services using that spelling; in this case <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">Search Engine Optimisation.</a> But a large proportion of people around the world will be spelling that last word with a Z rather than an S.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s John Mueller has tried to say it doesn&#8217;t make a difference but I rather think he&#8217;s over-simplifying the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My understanding is it doesn&#39;t play any role for SEO &#8212; maybe for users (and conversions), but not directly for SEO.</p>

<p>We can see in Google Search Console variants based on language are reported as different stats. I simply don&#8217;t believe Google&#8217;s system is allowing different spellings of words interchangeably. Searching for &#8220;Search Engine Optimisation&#8221; is much more likely to find my site than the American spelling precisely because I use it more often in my text.</p>
<p>There are ways I try to work around this. When I sell my services on specific service marketplaces (like <a href="https://pph.me/peter">PeoplePerHour)</a> they have the option to include &#8216;tags&#8217; behind the scenes &#8211; users don&#8217;t see those but they help support the sites&#8217; fairly rudimentary search functions. So that&#8217;s a nice way of making sure I&#8217;m found for both spellings there.</p>
<p>But the second part of John Mueller&#8217;s reply is the most interesting. Let&#8217;s imagine Google did have some magic way of knowing everything all language variations were referring to and would show results regardless of those differences. The meta information displayed isn&#8217;t going to change. I could be found for Optimization but the information in front of the user will <strong>still</strong> say Optimisation.</p>
<p>That slight language difference could put a potential client off.</p>
<p>The better approach would be to allow different meta settings for different languages. But even that is fraught with technical and other issues &#8211; really there is just no simple fix for this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue to sell my SEO services around the world, but predominantly to the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Purely for technical reasons &#8211; because when it comes to <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">delivering awesome SEO</a> I can do that for anyone, anywhere.</p>
