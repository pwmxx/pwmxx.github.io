								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>SEO is SEO, but when you&#8217;re advertising the different forms of English can get in the way.</h2>
<p><strong>I work with people all around the world, but there&#8217;s quite a bit more to achieving that than you might think.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to sell services around the world from the comfort of your own office is fantastic. But for those of us with geographically ambiguous spellings it raises a few issues.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2109" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I speak (and write) <em>British English</em> &#8211; or as we like to call it, just <em>English. </em>So naturally I list my services using that spelling; in this case <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">Search Engine Optimisation.</a> But a large proportion of people around the world will be spelling that last word with a Z rather than an S.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s John Mueller has tried to say it doesn&#8217;t make a difference but I rather think he&#8217;s over-simplifying the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My understanding is it doesn&#39;t play any role for SEO &#8212; maybe for users (and conversions), but not directly for SEO.</p>
<p>&mdash; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f34c.png" alt="🍌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> John <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f34c.png" alt="🍌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1100684747565686784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We can see in Google Search Console variants based on language are reported as different stats. I simply don&#8217;t believe Google&#8217;s system is allowing different spellings of words interchangeably. Searching for &#8220;Search Engine Optimisation&#8221; is much more likely to find my site than the American spelling precisely because I use it more often in my text.</p>
<p>There are ways I try to work around this. When I sell my services on specific service marketplaces (like <a href="https://pph.me/peter">PeoplePerHour)</a> they have the option to include &#8216;tags&#8217; behind the scenes &#8211; users don&#8217;t see those but they help support the sites&#8217; fairly rudimentary search functions. So that&#8217;s a nice way of making sure I&#8217;m found for both spellings there.</p>
<p>But the second part of John Mueller&#8217;s reply is the most interesting. Let&#8217;s imagine Google did have some magic way of knowing everything all language variations were referring to and would show results regardless of those differences. The meta information displayed isn&#8217;t going to change. I could be found for Optimization but the information in front of the user will <strong>still</strong> say Optimisation.</p>
<p>That slight language difference could put a potential client off.</p>
<p>The better approach would be to allow different meta settings for different languages. But even that is fraught with technical and other issues &#8211; really there is just no simple fix for this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue to sell my SEO services around the world, but predominantly to the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Purely for technical reasons &#8211; because when it comes to <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">delivering awesome SEO</a> I can do that for anyone, anywhere.</p>
