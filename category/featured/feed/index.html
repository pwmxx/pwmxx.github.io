								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>There&#8217;s been a number of news stories about the BERT update from Google.</h2>
<p><strong>These were followed by a slew of other stories about how the previous ones were misleading.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explain.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2322" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>If we go back several years to what was a very big announcement from Google &#8211; they turned on something they called RankBrain. At the time it was a new system and approach to search engine optimisation. They were using artificial intelligence to try to read webpages more like a human (actual visitors) would.</p>
<p>It was such a big deal because context suddenly became very important. The days of simply matching how many times you used certain keywords in your content against searches were over &#8211; it was crucial to write informative, useful content.</p>
<p>(That seems like a non-brainer anyway &#8211; content should always be useful and informative.)</p>
<p>But it was the beginning of the end for the concept of &#8216;how many keywords you can rank for&#8217;, or &#8216;just say this three times and you&#8217;ll rank really highly&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the years following Google has made all kinds of similar small updates to improve that system. They&#8217;re committed to returning useful well-written, informative results; and they&#8217;ve regularly made changes to their algorithm to further that aim.</p>
<h3>The BERT SEO update</h3>
<p>The BERT update really just pushes that to the next level. &#8216;Pattern matching&#8217; for specific phrases isn&#8217;t enough anymore, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is all in line with what I&#8217;ve been saying for years &#8211; don&#8217;t just write to specific words (whether they&#8217;re &#8216;long tail&#8217; or something else, the concept of expecting a certain amount of repetition to rock your SEO isn&#8217;t valid) &#8211; rather write well thought out content that explains what you&#8217;re trying to say.</p>
<p>(This is why some of the recent news stories about BERT backtracked about how important it was &#8211; because while it <strong>is</strong> important &#8211; it&#8217;s just a continuation of the same direction Google&#8217;s been going for a long time.)</p>
<p>To give you an example. You&#8217;d think the key with my own site is to mention <em>SEO</em> a lot. That&#8217;s easy to do &#8211; but harder to do in a way that makes it clear to the reader that I&#8217;m an authority on the subject, and even harder to impart useful information that might entice people back to my blog.</p>
<p>Simply repeating keywords is essentially keyword stuffing and Google knows it.</p>
<p>My recommendation for writing content hasn&#8217;t changed. Write to your audience, not to search engines. If you&#8217;re writing an about page then write about what you do and how you help people. Useful, natural words and phrases will come out of that anyway.</p>
<p>Your visitors &#8211; and increasingly your search engine ranking &#8211; will thank you for it.</p>
<h3>Why context matters so much for SEO</h3>
<p>As search engines continue to prepare for voice search being used more often (voice searches are usually quite conversational in their wording) context becomes more important.</p>
<p>To give a really basically example, let&#8217;s think about a site that may have been a review for a florist. Even if the content said something negative, for example &#8220;What a rubbish florist&#8221;, previously it would have helped rank for the search query &#8216;florist&#8217;. Increasingly Google can understand the negativity there and is less likely to present that site to someone who clearly wants to find a reputable local florist.</p>
<p>That really is a very basic example, but context is <em>so</em> important.</p>
<h3>What needs changing for your WordPress SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">As a WordPress SEO expert</a> every change and update to SEO algorithms always comes back to the same question, &#8220;How does this impact WordPress SEO?&#8221; The answer in this case is <em>very little.</em> <a href="https://peterwm.com/homepage-faq-structured-data-to-improve-your-seo-rank/">Unlike structured data</a> or other updates that necessitate coding changes to your site, this really is all about content.</p>
<p>Fortunately WordPress itself is all about content and the ease of editing or creating it &#8211; so that&#8217;s a real boon. It&#8217;s easy to edit your site&#8217;s content to make it as contextual, human readable and useful as possible.</p>
<p>But there is no immediate need to jump in add or remove any plugins or systems.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>This is a creative use of Google Search Console I&#8217;ve come up with for some easy SEO wins</h2>
<p><strong>And it&#8217;s been working really well on all my testing sites.</strong></p>
<p>Google Search Console (GSC) is Google&#8217;s official stats system for organic search, and has the most useful data about your site&#8217;s ranking, visits, clicks, etc.</p>
<p>They changed the interface for it some time ago and keep adding more data in it. One new page will show you all the pages in your site they&#8217;ve crawled, but chosen <strong>not</strong> to include in search results.</p>
<p>So they know about these pages, but don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth including in their results pages. The effect of that is these pages are <em>not</em> actually helping with your SEO at all. From an SEO viewpoint they may as well not be there.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons I&#8217;ve found why otherwise useful content is being ignored by Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s just too short</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not on-topic enough</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your content might just be too short</h3>
<p>This is fairly self-explanatory. Unless you&#8217;ve got 300+ words of text on a page it will often be ignored.</p>
<h3>Your content might not be on-topic <em>enough</em></h3>
<p>The best way to explain this is with an example, let&#8217;s think about a digital marketing firm. Perhaps when they started they offered a variety of services from social media content to web development and SEO.</p>
<p>Well now they just focus on the latter. Their homepage is about it, all their services pages are too &#8211; but they have old blog posts about their older services.</p>
<p>Google knows what a site&#8217;s core service offering is. And things that might fall outside that &#8211; either because they&#8217;re just off topic or simply old and reflect what a business *used* to be about &#8211; they&#8217;re likely to get ignored as well.</p>
<h3>Re-purpose old content to get it indexed and working for your SEO!</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s my recommendation. Have a look through the list of crawled but not indexed pages and see if there are any you can fix.</p>
<p>Doing this myself I found any short pages I fleshed out, or outdated ones I re-tooled to reflect what I&#8217;m doing now &#8211; every single one got picked up again by Google.</p>
<p>In some cases it was just a matter of adding an extra paragraph to an existing post. That&#8217;s not nearly as cumbersome as writing an entirely new one but essentially gets a whole extra page indexed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Using FAQs on your site to get extra traffic from search results</h2>
<p><strong>Google loves a good Q&amp;A, and they&#8217;re great for your search engine optimisation.</strong></p>
<p>This is an excellent technique that Google has been responding to very positively recently. It involves a fairly interesting type of structured data.</p>
<p>Structured data is a series of tags and what&#8217;s known as <em>microdata</em> that Google, Bing and Yahoo all use to work out what content on your site matches specific, common types of information like phone numbers. It primarily sits in your pages&#8217; code &#8211; it&#8217;s not something the user sees directly. Although in the case of FAQs you do want them to be able to see them as well &#8211; that way your front-end information matches what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes. Google definitely wants to see that the information you&#8217;re supplying <em>them</em> is also what you&#8217;re giving to your <em>users.</em></p>
<p>You may have noticed little &#8216;People also ask&#8217; <em>click-to-open</em> sections like this on Google results pages before:</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-2297 alignnone" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png" alt="" width="440" height="316" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-240x173.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation.png 658w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Those questions and answers are being pulled from web pages with &#8216;FAQ&#8217; structured data on their homepages.</p>
<p>This technique involves adding an FAQ section to your own homepage, and then having the appropriate code added to those so Google can pick them up correctly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried this with a handful of clients and most have seen a 3-4 ranking place increase as a result! Even if Google doesn&#8217;t end up using your FAQs on their results page, the effect is the same; they just like to see the code in place.</p>
<p>So this is well worth implementing as part of your SEO strategy.</p>
<p>When writing FAQs for this purpose though it&#8217;s best to make them somewhat generic &#8211; they should be about your industry generally rather than about your specific offering. (If you take a look at the ones I wrote <a href="https://peterwm.com/">on my own homepage,</a> you&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re <em>predominantly</em> about SEO and it&#8217;s advantages rather than being about the services I offer myself.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like me to implement this for you <a href="mailto:peter@webcraft.co">please just get in touch</a> &#8211; and of course I can do it all for you as part of <a href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">an ongoing SEO campaign too.</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>SEO is SEO, but when you&#8217;re advertising the different forms of English can get in the way.</h2>
<p><strong>I work with people all around the world, but there&#8217;s quite a bit more to achieving that than you might think.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to sell services around the world from the comfort of your own office is fantastic. But for those of us with geographically ambiguous spellings it raises a few issues.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2109" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I speak (and write) <em>British English</em> &#8211; or as we like to call it, just <em>English. </em>So naturally I list my services using that spelling; in this case <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">Search Engine Optimisation.</a> But a large proportion of people around the world will be spelling that last word with a Z rather than an S.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s John Mueller has tried to say it doesn&#8217;t make a difference but I rather think he&#8217;s over-simplifying the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My understanding is it doesn&#39;t play any role for SEO &#8212; maybe for users (and conversions), but not directly for SEO.</p>
<p>&mdash; 🍌 John 🍌 (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1100684747565686784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We can see in Google Search Console variants based on language are reported as different stats. I simply don&#8217;t believe Google&#8217;s system is allowing different spellings of words interchangeably. Searching for &#8220;Search Engine Optimisation&#8221; is much more likely to find my site than the American spelling precisely because I use it more often in my text.</p>
<p>There are ways I try to work around this. When I sell my services on specific service marketplaces (like <a href="https://pph.me/peter">PeoplePerHour)</a> they have the option to include &#8216;tags&#8217; behind the scenes &#8211; users don&#8217;t see those but they help support the sites&#8217; fairly rudimentary search functions. So that&#8217;s a nice way of making sure I&#8217;m found for both spellings there.</p>
<p>But the second part of John Mueller&#8217;s reply is the most interesting. Let&#8217;s imagine Google did have some magic way of knowing everything all language variations were referring to and would show results regardless of those differences. The meta information displayed isn&#8217;t going to change. I could be found for Optimization but the information in front of the user will <strong>still</strong> say Optimisation.</p>
<p>That slight language difference could put a potential client off.</p>
<p>The better approach would be to allow different meta settings for different languages. But even that is fraught with technical and other issues &#8211; really there is just no simple fix for this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue to sell my SEO services around the world, but predominantly to the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Purely for technical reasons &#8211; because when it comes to <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">delivering awesome SEO</a> I can do that for anyone, anywhere.</p>
