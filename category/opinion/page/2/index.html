is alternatively titled: <em>Will you still love me, tomorrow?</em><p>I had considered something much more risqué to do with trying before you buy, but it seemed a bit crass in the context I intended it.</p><p>Whenever you buy something online, you have options. Product choices, price, and most of all, who to buy from. For every product there are several dozen people queuing up to sell it to you.</p><p>And the most successful online business are unsurprisingly <em>excellent</em> at selling.</p><p>But how can you tell who is going to offer you good after sale care? And the the case of products you buy to interact with online (i.e., online systems that you’ll log into to manage) how can you spot the people who care about you after you’ve parted with your cash, from those who just want to keep on selling?</p><p>I’ll start by putting this out there–for all sorts of reason, GoDaddy are not a company I recommend. In fact I do my best to warn people off them.</p><p>And this is a prime example of why. Below you’ll see a screenshot of the GoDaddy homepage. I’ve taken the liberty of highlighting in red, any area of the screen which is wholly, and unquestionably (I went easy on them frankly) devoted to selling.</p><p>Now to be fair their is a prominent support line number which is likely useful to both new customers, and exisiting ones.</p><p>But the only section <em>devoted</em> to existing customers is that small, plain looking “Log In to My Account” button on the top left. Now for sure a lot of business run this way, they are predominantly sales on the first page, and then the bulk of their information (and interactive systems) for clients is behind a password.</p><p>But I’d expect to see an obvious login box, with some graphic element drawing out attention to it. Not something so small my daughter’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-Monkeys" target="_blank">Sea Monkeys</a> could probably ride it like a tiny train.</p><p>GoDaddy’s after-sale support is well known to be, frankly, appalling. Unless you’re buying more products from them in which case they’d love to help you, yes sir, of course ma’am, have a nice day!</p><p>And you know what? I can see that right there, from their homepage. They haven’t given screen real estate to existing customers except in the most perfunctory, absolutely necessary way.</p><p>It’s just an example, albeit a solid one. Before you sign up for an online service (knowing you can very rarely try before you buy), have a look at how much they value their customers, by looking for screen space they’ve devoted to them.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-554" title="How to spot good after-sale customer care Peter Mahoney" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20341'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="How to spot good after-sale customer care Peter Mahoney" width="500" height="341" data-lazy-srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space-500x341.jpg 500w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space-300x205.jpg 300w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space.jpg 990w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space-500x341.jpg"></p><noscript><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-554" title="How to spot good after-sale customer care Peter Mahoney" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space-500x341.jpg" alt="How to spot good after-sale customer care Peter Mahoney" width="500" height="341" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space-500x341.jpg 500w,https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space-300x205.jpg 300w,https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/godaddy-advertising-space.jpg 990w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></noscript><p> </p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/hints-and-tips/" rel="category tag">Hints & Tips</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/opinion/" rel="category tag">Opinion</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/user-experience/" rel="category tag">User experience</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/advertising/" rel="tag">advertising</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/after-sale-care/" rel="tag">after-sale care</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/customers/" rel="tag">customers</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/godaddy/" rel="tag">godaddy</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/online-services/" rel="tag">online services</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/support/" rel="tag">support</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-423 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-content-2 category-opinion category-social-networking tag-arsenal tag-commentary tag-facebook-2 tag-instagram tag-social-media tag-twitter tag-warren-ellis entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/warren-ellis-and-peter-mahoney-on-social-media/">Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2013-01-15T12:39:43+00:00">January 15, 2013</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-428" title="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150" data-lazy-src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warren-ellis-150x150.jpg"></p><noscript><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-428" title="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warren-ellis-150x150.jpg" alt="Warren Ellis on social media, my thoughts Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150"></noscript>Warren Ellis, English author and social commentator, wrote a wonderful post shortly before Christmas in which he discussed the end of the first wave of social media.<blockquote><p>Twitter alters its terms of access to its information, thereby harming the services that built themselves on that information. Which was stupid, because Twitter gets fewer and fewer material benefits from allowing people to use its water. And why would you build a service that relies on a private company’s assets anyway? Facebook changes its terms of access regularly. It’s broken its own Pages system and steadily grows more invasive and desperate. Instagram, now owned by Facebook, just went through its first major change in terms of service. Which went as badly as anyone who’s interacted with Facebook would expect. As Twitter disconnected itself from sharing services like IFTTT, so Instagram disconnected itself from Twitter. Flickr’s experiencing what will probably be a brief renaissance due to having finally built a decent iOS app, but its owners, Yahoo!, are expert in stealing defeat from the jaws of victory. Tumblr seems to me to be spiking in popularity, which coincides neatly with their hiring an advertising sales director away from Groupon, a company described by Techcrunch last year as basically loansharking by any other name.</p><p>This may be the end of the cycle that began with Friendster and Livejournal. Not the end of social media, by any means, obviously. But it feels like this is the point at where the current systems seize up for a bit. Perhaps not even in ways that most people will notice. But social media seems now to be clearly calcifying into Big Media, with Big Media problems like cable-style carriage disputes. Frame the Twitter-Instagram spat in terms of Virginmedia not being able to carry Sky Atlantic in the UK, say (I know there are many more US examples).</p></blockquote><p>This first wave, or cycle as he calls it, can best be described as one of ecstatic enthusiasm bordering on insanity.</p><p>His closing statement wonders if anyone regrets giving up their own websites in favour of just using social platforms yet. I bet the answer is yes, and I’ve been warning people against that for a long time. More on that another day though.</p><p>To focus on the core message of the piece—yes, he’s right. People have been so far up social media’s behind that they forgot to try to turn the lights on to check where they were.</p><p>And just where are they? At the mercy of a bunch or other companies who have very right (although very little market-mandate) to change their terms of service and take what you thought was yours.</p><p>Issues of content ownership and the like aside though, I’ve been waiting for this bubble to burst for a long while—because it’s time to simply accept social media, rather than jumping up and down on the sofa about it.</p><p>Is social media exciting? Of course. New technology, ways to reach your audience and methods of interaction always are. But they aren’t the be-all and end-all. Television still has exciting content. Radio programs can still blow my mind.</p><p>Once all the hype settles down, content becomes the clarifying point, sorting the overly excited from the thoughtful.</p><p>When approaching social media for any business purpose, look at it in the context of all your online work, sites, portfolios, information, etc. If you just think outside the box a little bit, you can have a very large and well rounded arsenal of online communications at your disposal. Which can all work together to improve your bottom line.</p><p>I’ve been waiting for a long time for people to realise that as exciting and useful as social media is, it’s one tool you have at your disposal, and you have many. Make them all work together, for you.</p><p>Think of it like this, there will always be new waves. And just watching them from the beach is no good, you need to ride them. But stay on top of them where you can see what’s happening around you, rather than falling in and finding you’ve crashed up on a beach with no David Hasselhoff in sight.</p><p>via <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=14546">Warren Ellis » The Social Web: End Of The First Cycle</a>.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/content-2/" rel="category tag">Content</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/opinion/" rel="category tag">Opinion</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/social-networking/" rel="category tag">Social networking</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/arsenal/" rel="tag">arsenal</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/commentary/" rel="tag">commentary</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/facebook-2/" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/instagram/" rel="tag">instagram</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/social-media/" rel="tag">social media</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/twitter/" rel="tag">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/warren-ellis/" rel="tag">warren ellis</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-376 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-opinion tag-chriastmas-tree tag-dots-and-boxes tag-how-i-work tag-pixels tag-planning entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/how-i-work/">How I work</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2012-12-17T09:48:29+00:00">December 17, 2012</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-378" title="How I work Peter Mahoney" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="How I work Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150" data-lazy-src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/back-of-an-envelope-150x150.jpg"></p><noscript><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-378" title="How I work Peter Mahoney" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/back-of-an-envelope-150x150.jpg" alt="How I work Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150"></noscript>You’d be surprised how much of my working is done on the back of envelopes.

Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150"></noscript>I’m the first to admit, I struggled with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> at first. Not that it’s hard to use or anything, in fact it’s incredibly simple. But I struggled to find its place in my social-media-life.<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/peterwm/" target="_blank">I’ve had my profile</a> up there for years, and I’d fleshed it out (past jobs, current responsibilities, photo, all the things that seemed important) but I wasn’t interacting with anyone.</p><p>All my colleagues and ex-colleagues were on Facebook. LinkedIn let me post messages and share other people’s updates, but so much less then my other social profiles.</p><p>Then I started using it regularly; I just made sure I logged in a couple of times a week. Recommended a couple of people. Wrote to someone I could only find on LinkedIn that I hadn’t spoken to for a while.</p><p>Before I knew it I became a regular. And the more I used it, the more people found me. Job offers, professional queries, community discussions, they’ve all become an important part of what I do.</p><p>I’ve found even people I do communicate with elsewhere interact differently on LinkedIn. We act in the way we want to present ourselves to our workmates, bosses and clients.</p><p>This is the advantage of LinkedIn. Not only can you build your online community, but you can be sure that your interactions on it are going to be framed in a professional manner, and of a higher quality. To this day I’ve not seen a single photo of a kitten on LinkedIn.</p><p>Please don’t be the first.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/online-community-2/" rel="category tag">Online community</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/opinion/" rel="category tag">Opinion</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/social-networking/" rel="category tag">Social networking</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/facebook-2/" rel="tag">facebook</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/kittens/" rel="tag">kittens</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/linkedin/" rel="tag">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/social-networking-2/" rel="tag">social networking</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-250 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-online-community-2 category-opinion category-social-networking tag-communitiy tag-dictionary tag-online tag-online-communities tag-online-community tag-ritual tag-transformative entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/online-communities-and-ritual/">Online communities and ritual</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2012-11-13T10:01:32+00:00">November 13, 2012</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-252" title="Online communities and ritual Peter Mahoney" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Online communities and ritual Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150" data-lazy-src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/onine_community_ritual-150x150.jpg"></p><noscript><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-252" title="Online communities and ritual Peter Mahoney" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/onine_community_ritual-150x150.jpg" alt="Online communities and ritual Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150"></noscript>A wonderful line from the Wikipedia article about Online communities.<blockquote><p>An online community is a virtual community that exists online and whose members enable its existence through taking part in membership ritual.</p></blockquote><p>I love the idea of describing our online interactions as ritual. After all, ritual permeates all of what we do. I even brush my teeth in a certain way that has become ritualistic. (Start on the lower left, scrubbing around the bottom before moving to the top).</p><p>Ritual can, at it’s most basic, be defined as:</p><p><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ritual" target="_blank"><strong>5. </strong><strong>a. </strong> A detailed method of procedure faithfully or regularly followed</a></p><p>That for me is it’s most basic meaning. I love ritual as an experience, something that can be shared, and transformative.</p><p>And that is the highest ideal of any online community, to help individuals change through participation in a shared group experience. The online medium of course is very different to a religious or secular ceremony, but it’s differences afford people the option to engage in a different way, to play out other parts of themselves, which is turn allows for a completely different transformation.</p><p>That’s my thought of the day. It’s amazing the train of thoughts a simple Wikipedia search can inspire.</p><p>Anyway, I’ve brushed my teeth, now on to work.</p><p>via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community">Online community – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/online-community-2/" rel="category tag">Online community</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/opinion/" rel="category tag">Opinion</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/social-networking/" rel="category tag">Social networking</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/communitiy/" rel="tag">communitiy</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/dictionary/" rel="tag">dictionary</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/online/" rel="tag">online</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/online-communities/" rel="tag">online communities</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/online-community/" rel="tag">online community</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/ritual/" rel="tag">ritual</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/transformative/" rel="tag">transformative</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-204 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-online-community-2 category-opinion category-social-networking tag-buy-followers tag-dishonest tag-ebay tag-experiment tag-twitter entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/i-just-bought-30000-twitter-followers/">I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2012-11-08T11:29:04+00:00">November 8, 2012</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-205" title="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150" data-lazy-src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/buy_twitter_followers_online-150x150.png"></p><noscript><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-205" title="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/buy_twitter_followers_online-150x150.png" alt="I just bought 30,000 Twitter followers Peter Mahoney" width="150" height="150"></noscript>I’m breaking my own rules, so you don’t have to.<p>I maintain, and always have, that quality is the key component to any online community. A community of 200 people, with regular contributions from 90% of them, is a far better experience for your users, members, and clients, than 20,000 with .09% engagement.</p><p>Strong communities build strong reliances for your brand. I tell everyone this. I regularly check my online tribe to ensure it’s filled with real, engaged people.</p><p>Having said that, I just purchased 30,000 Twitter followers. I’m saying it openly, because it’s all a big test. An experiment of epic quantity.</p><p>Here’s the logic—there are all sorts of places selling bot followers for Twitter (“bot” means these aren’t real people, they only bolster your follower numbers) and just as many blog posts from people saying they’re a waste of time.</p><p>But of the two dozen bloggers I responded to, <em>not one of them</em> has done it themselves. I can’t get my hands on enough unbiased, experiential evidence to say for sure that they’re a waste of time.</p><p>I expect they are, I’ve always said so, but I want to be able to say it with the confidence that comes from having made the mistake first hand.</p><p>The only possible positive I can conceive of, is that there are users who might see your tweet retreated by an actual Twitter user, click your profile, and then feel assured that you’re worth following because thousands of other people already do—even though they really don’t. It’s a trick of building confidence in yourself by, basically, pretending lots of people already <em>do</em> see you as an opinion leader.</p><p>It’s dishonest, sure. And I still don’t think it’s any match for organic community growth. But I’ve done it now, and I’m telling you about it so it’s not quite as dishonest.</p><p>Naturally I’ll let you know how it goes.

I’m slightly more than geeky when it comes to tech, and I’ve been wearing these huge glasses <em>way</em> before hipsters first picked them up.<p>However, there are a few things about me that separate me out from the nerd crowd. And one of the biggies is…I can communicate, with you, in a way you’ll understand. In fact a few of my clients about a decade ago took to calling me “The geek who can speak”. At the time I wasn’t sure if I should be flattered or flummoxed. I’m still unsure.</p><p>Anyway, quite famously, when you seek advice from a nerd they’re likely to respond “Have you tried turning it on and off again”, and for good reason—it usually works.</p><p>I had an interaction with a support helpdesk this morning; one of their WordPress themes was playing up and I submitted a support ticket, knowing that it would take them at least 24 hours to get to it, so I was hoping for a helpful reply.</p><p>“Have you upgraded to the latest version?” was all I got back. Fullstop. It’s the software equivalent of hitting the power button twice, because it is, to most developers mind’s, the most likely thing to fix the problem.</p><p>The other thing it has in common with making use of the on/off switch, is it’s the path of least resistance. Now, personally I take offence when asked by anyone, in any situation, “Have you done the least thing you possible could without having done nothing?” and this situation is no different.</p><p>Anyway, I’m sharing this to give some practical advice. When writing to support lines about online products, use this easy to follow formula:</p><blockquote><p>To whom it may concern,</p><p>I have updated my software to the latest version as available from your website, but am still finding that {insert rest of issue here}.</p></blockquote><p>I replied to the less-than-welcome response I got of course, just a few minutes ago. And now I’m going to wait the inevitable 24 hours for the follow-up.</p><p>I just hope for everyone’s sake that they don’t come back asking me to restart the web server. I’ve had these giant glasses a long time, and I’m not afraid to use them.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><p class="entry-meta"><span class="entry-categories">Filed Under: <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/opinion/" rel="category tag">Opinion</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/wordpress/" rel="category tag">Wordpress</a></span> <span class="entry-tags">Tagged With: <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/geeks/" rel="tag">geeks</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/glasses/" rel="tag">glasses</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/nerds/" rel="tag">nerds</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/woothemes/" rel="tag">woothemes</a>, <a href="https://peterwm.com/tag/wp/" rel="tag">wordpress</a></span></p></footer></article><article class="post-81 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-opinion tag-bittorrent tag-drones tag-piratebay tag-webserver entry" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a class="entry-title-link" rel="bookmark" href="https://peterwm.com/the-pirate-bay-the-galaxys-most-resilient-bittorrent-site/">Piracy, drones and dreaming.</a></h2><p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2012-10-18T10:58:35+00:00">October 18, 2012</time> by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://peterwm.com/author/peter/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Peter Warwick-Mahoney</span></a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>As controversial as they may be, I have to hand it to The Pirate Bay, they certainly keep themselves at the forefront of technology.</p><blockquote><p>Our data flows around in thousands of clouds, in deeply encrypted forms, ready to be used when necessary.
