								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually do resolutions or anything like that, but as this site is now a few years old it makes sense to resolve to make myself a new one.</p>
<p>It might take a bit longer than usual because I&#8217;ll be doing it all with a &#8220;static site generator&#8221;, which is simply a useful way to generate sites that don&#8217;t have really advanced features, like e-commerce. But it allows for blindingly fast sites (in fact they load about 4x faster than a WordPress site!) so is a good direction to head in.</p>
<p>Of course if you want a <a href="/wordpress-website-development/">new website for 2018,</a> or just to make sure your existing one <a href="/one-off-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">gets as many visitors as possible,</a> let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all year.</p>

<p>Google Apps (used for business email, file sharing, calendaring etc.) is now rebranded as G Suite.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a bad mid-90s R&amp;B group. (Try as I might, I can&#8217;t forgetÂ &#8220;Rappin&#8217; 4-Tay&#8221;.)*</p>
<p>In their official blog post, Google said this is more in keeping more with their mission to provide a series of tools businesses use to further their own purposes. Basically rather than a series of individual applications coming together they see it as a stock set of tools within one Google system.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Google Apps proved to be an invaluable tools for companies, schools and universities, and I do hope G Suite continues to build on and improve those systems.</p>
<p>But I do have one niggling concern in the back of my mind. Google Apps used to be free for small firms, then overnight all new accounts were subject to a subscription fee. Existing free accounts continued to run with charge &#8211; but any change to Apps brings a fear they might start to charge for those grandfathered accounts.</p>
<p>And with a change this big, well &#8211; Google Apps keep free accounts, but will G Suite?</p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.googleblog.com/2016/09/all-together-now-introducing-G-Suite.html" target="_blank">Read the original Google blog post<br />
</a>*Although I thought of making this joke myself, I wasn&#8217;t the first, <a href="https://s3z.me/s/908" target="_blank">so credit goes here</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing website development since 1995, and SEO since 1998. Even according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwell-explains-the-10000-hour-rule-2014-6?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s 10,000 hour</a>Â rule, that makes me an expert in both areas a few times over.</p>
<p>I just had a moment this morning that reminded myself just how experienced I am what I do. One clientÂ signed up for my <a href="https://peterwm.com/monthly-wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">monthly SEO service</a> a few weeks ago. Normally it&#8217;s a month before I issue the first update but I do like to keep an eye on how things are going and check the data fairly regularly.</p>
<p>So when he wrote to ask how things were progressing I was very happy to be able to send him this graph, showing the number of times his site was seen in Google search results over the past 90 days, with a crudely drawn arrow indicating when he started working with me.</p>
<p><img  title="How good am I? Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1651" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/great-monhtly-seo-440x134.png"  alt="How good am I?

<p>So how good am I? Very good. I&#8217;m just not always very good at telling you about it.</p>

<p><strong>LIES.</strong></p>
<p>I know I bang on about the trouble with buying backlinks. Regular readers will be familiar with my disdain for people selling the impossibleâsince Google&#8217;s Panda algorithm tries very hard to find people buying links, saying any scheme like this is &#8220;Panda safe&#8221; or even worse, &#8220;Panda friendly&#8221; is just a plain old lie.</p>
<p>So, at the risk of repeating myself, I&#8217;m going to say some things I&#8217;ve said before, albeit in a more concise and succinct form.</p>
<p>It is true that Google does like to see links to your site. But they are excellent at discerning real links (where someone liked your site or service enough to link to it) from purchased ones.</p>
<p>I generally stand against buying backlinks, because of my &#8220;SEO ethos&#8221;. My ethos is simple by the wayâGoogle have given us a swag of information regarding what search engines do and do not wantâso I say we give them what they&#8217;re after. And avoid what they&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>Plus, I have about three jobs a week come in from people who bought back links and got caughtâand dropped off Google completely. When they penalise you, they <strong>really</strong>Â hit you hard.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, really awesome backlinks would certainly help your SEO. But 99% of the time buying them is not awesome, and therefore I recommend avoiding it.</p>
<p>I, like Google, see SEO as a long game, if done properly. But also, if done properly, it &#8220;sticks&#8221;. A site with good SEO that&#8217;s risen to the top should stay at the top.</p>
<p>And with that, I shall get down from my well-trodden soap-box. That&#8217;s the end of my manifesto for the evening.</p>

<p>However, this post isn&#8217;t commenting on piracy as a topic, rather Ann&#8217;s own comment that a Google search for Netflix&#8217;s House of Cards (another very popular TV program) doesn&#8217;t even bring up the official site in the top 50 results.</p>
<p>On the surface, she&#8217;s saying &#8220;look at all the piracy sites that come before the proper one!&#8221;, but behind that is the idea that by default, the official site for anything should come top. The problem is, <strong>Netflix&#8217;s site for House of Cards has terrible SEO,</strong> that&#8217;s why it performs so poorly.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not nearly enough textual content, and the meta tags are actually about Netflix, not the show, and therefore they score very poorly for relevancy (how many words in the tags also appear on the page) which is likely to have them penalised by Google, not shoved higher up the rankings.</p>
<p>This serves as an excellent cautionary tale. Just because you feel you deserve to be in the top spot, doesn&#8217;t mean you will be. If other people are writing about your industry, product or service, and do it better than you doâthey will beat you in the rankings.</p>
<p>If you care about your position, <a title="WordPress SEO" href="https://peterwm.com/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">invest in some proper, industry-leading SEO</a>âand get where you want to be.</p>

<p>I talk a lot about the importance of doing SEO properly, and not trying to cheat the search engines.</p>
<p>Of all the tricks out there, the most tempting by far is buying backlinks.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google wants lots of sites to link to us, right? So let&#8217;s just get some and get moving up those rankings!</p></blockquote>
<p>Terrible, <em>terrible</em> idea.</p>
<p>A client of mine bought some from a seller claiming to be Google safe, Panda safe, Penguin safe, PR10, quality links.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t be Google-safe. All that will ever mean is they haven&#8217;t caught you (or the system being used to generate your links) yet. But they&#8217;ve been promising for a decade that they will, and more often than not, they do.</p>
<p>The image above is a bit small, but I&#8217;m sure you can pinpoint when they bought the so-called &#8220;safe&#8221; links.</p>
<p>Their sales fell proportionately.</p>

That statement is a little over-simplified because the process of moving really takes a lot longer than the single day the truck is filled with your stuff.</p>
<p>In some ways we&#8217;re still moving, but telling ourselves we&#8217;ve settled (or at least are settling) into the house we plan for our kids to grow up in.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have bought a house in this economy, in our favourite town (Glastonbury). There <em>was</em> some fairly well-attended shindig in the area around the time we moved, but by and large it stayed out of our way.</p>
<p>The day of the move was itself stressful&mdash;as they tend to be. Everything took longer than planned; we got everything in only to realise we&#8217;d designated the wrong rooms and needed to move it all about, and just where the hell are my clean pants anyway.</p>
<p>And now I find myself settled in my office, with my computer on, speakers operational, second monitor shining it&#8217;s light upon me, and I&#8217;m struck by how reliable the net can be.</p>
<p>Sure, Facebook can&#8217;t make up its mind how it wants to dress itself, email servers can be a bit of an arse sometimes, and Amazon is still convenient, if not a bit ethically questionable.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s all right there. The methods I use to interact with friends and family across the world, the means to put dinner on my families table&mdash;they haven&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p>My surrounds have, but I have this little window through which the world doesn&#8217;t look so different.</p>
<p>And while technology is mercifully always adapting, it can also function as as a dependable &#8220;room with a view&#8221; from any house, train, or airport lounge.</p>
<p>In turn I reflect on my own website. While I was packing boxes, only to unpack them the next day, and helping move heavy bits of furniture that I&#8217;m sure we paid someone else to carry about, my website was viewed by 200 different people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve carved out a piece of digital real estate, that even in my absence, when my mind is firmly elsewhere, still attracts people from all manner of places. It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m happy with it.</p>

<ol>
<li>There isn&#8217;t enough of it in the world</li>
<li>I&#8217;m providing a service, and conduct myself as such</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t get precious about things like a lot of developers and designers do. (Honestly, people need to get over themselves sometimes!)</li>
<li>And this one&#8217;s really important; I both take pride in my work, and feed my family with it. Anything less than a five-star service means I&#8217;ll have less than a perfect reputation, which keeps food off my children&#8217;s table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 3. is a particularly interested topic&#8211;I have known people who get so precious that they refuse to deliver what their client asks for!</p>
<p>Certainly, as a consultant and professional with 17 years experience, if I think a project or part thereof should be done differently to the brief, I&#8217;ll suggest it with a solid rationale. But I also accept that if someone really wants to stick with their idea, they should be able too.</p>
<p>In some cases it boils down to this, I <em>know</em> web development, design, and online community&#8211;but my clients know their own businesses better than I! That&#8217;s why I like to get to know my clients and their businesses, because I want to make sure they&#8217;re using the web as effectively as they can for their business model.</p>
