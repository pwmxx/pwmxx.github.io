										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I had a client recently who (for reasons exclusively to do with the inexperience of their website&#8217;s designer) turned off one of the SEO plugins I had installed and configured for them.</h2>
<p><strong>It happened shortly after I carried out an <a title="Wordpress SEO overhaul work" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">initial SEO overhaul</a> on their site, so gives us a valuable insight into the effect of getting SEO done, and the removing it again.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2364" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png" alt="" width="440" height="132" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-240x72.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-768x230.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very small (and brand new company), but you can see the effects in this graph &#8211; taken directly from Google Search Console.</p>
<p>Initially after my work their SEO stats began to shoot up, gaining traction and upward momentum. Immediately after deactivating just one plugin it plummeted back to its original position.</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t use to happen so quickly. If you took SEO work off a site, or just fell behind with updates and changes to best practice, things would trail off over time. It now appears not having the very best SEO at all times leads to an immediate decrease in SEO authority. Because so many website owners (your competitors!) invest in SEO these days it means any time you don&#8217;t have it working, they can rise above you in the rankings.</p>
<p>But other SEO professionals have tried the same thing (turning off a single SEO plugin on their own testing sites) and see the same result. <em>The drop is nearly immediate.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I&#8217;m regularly amazed at the poor quality of SEO work I come across daily.</h2>
<p><strong>And the attitude of the cowboys that do it is just shocking.</strong></p>
<p>I recently had an exchange with a potential SEO client. At least they <em>thought</em> they were a potential client.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2226" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-440x248.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="248" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-440x248.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-240x135.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-768x432.jpg 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Before I begin I should point out about 70% of my work is for digital marketing agencies who on-sell my work to their clients. I&#8217;m more than happy to do that &#8211; but it&#8217;s incredible how many people try to take the piss.</p>
<p>Perhaps every other week I have an order come through for a marketing agency that sells SEO work &#8211; who want me to SEO their own site but <strong>not</strong> their clients&#8217;! They don&#8217;t have enough knowledge, experience or confidence to SEO their own site &#8211; but they&#8217;ll happily charge people to do shoddy work for them.</p>
<p>This recent exchange I had wasn&#8217;t even that honest about the intent though &#8211; it was from someone who said they were just an ordinary client, but betrayed themselves with a few key phrases I&#8217;ve become very au fait with:<br />
<em>I don&#8217;t have time for this one</em> = &#8220;I charge people for SEO myself but for one reason or another can&#8217;t do this one. Probably because I don&#8217;t know how to deliver quality search engine optimisation.&#8221;<br />
<em>If I order now, can you do it this afternoon</em> (asked at 3pm) = &#8220;Not only do I have no idea how long decent WordPress SEO takes, but I&#8217;m kinda of pushy and rude too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the exchange I had the question that guarantees I&#8217;m talking to a cowboy:<br />
<em>I need 500+ backlinks too.</em></p>
<p>Also, presumably, by 5pm that day. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret I strongly dislike the industry that&#8217;s cropped up around the automatic creation of backlinks. <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/backlinks/">I blog about it a lot</a> &#8211; but the short version is Google says it&#8217;s against their rules and they actively try to find and penalise sites that do it.</p>
<p>I replied with <a href="https://peterwm.com/backlinks-are-great-for-seo-but-only-if-theyre-legitimate/">a link to one of my posts on the subject,</a> thinking there was still a chance I was talking with someone genuinely interested in proper white-hat SEO. Then I got this reply.</p>
<blockquote><p>All SEOs use techniques that google ideally would not want you to use because they work, right? At the end of the day, google&#8217;s ranking process is just an algorithm. The recent planned Google updates for Links coming in march 2020 may help clean up link building but SEOs will still find holes in the algorithm.</p>
<p>The clients you work with surly (sic) care more about results than a multi-billionaire business algorithm and how well you follow these guidelines?</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s just a small part of it. There were 20+ other questions demanding I prove all manner of things about SEO and the correct approach to it. In and of itself that&#8217;s not a problem (I like to respond to questions to help people wherever I can) but it was all just so aggressively <em>defensive.</em></p>
<p>I replied as honestly and directly as I could.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to be a good fit together.</p>
<p>The whole idea that<br />
<em>All SEOs use techniques that google ideally would not want you to use because they work, right?</em></p>
<p>isn&#8217;t in line with my or Google&#8217;s ethos. Or what&#8217;s considered best practice in the industry.</p>
<p>Grey and blackhat techniques might work for a while, but never in the long term. And my clients are interested in long term success, not quick wins that end up hurting them when Google adjusts their systems accordingly. When you do SEO properly you&#8217;ll find Google algorithm updates actually IMPROVE ranking.</p>
<p>To be really honest you seem to be defending what could best be described as a <strong>cowboy approach.</strong> And that sort of SEO tends to lead to algorithm changes harming ranking rather than helping.</p>
<p>So while I do genuinely wish you all the best for the future, I hope you&#8217;ll understand that I&#8217;m not interested in working with you. We clearly have very different ideas of what good SEO is.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly not the most diplomatic response I&#8217;ve ever sent. But if someone is going to suggest my clients want short-lived gains that come at the cost of massive penalties later I feel like <em>they&#8217;re</em> being insulted. Good SEO (like good business) looks for long-term solutions.</p>
<p>The bit where I did try to be diplomatic was that last line.</p>
<blockquote><p>We clearly have very different ideas of what good SEO is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because search engine optimisation is not about a personal belief or idea about what you want it to be. It <strong>is</strong> based on an algorithm &#8211; a predictable one. There&#8217;s evidence to show what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Why would you ever do anything except the very best approach?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>All off-site SEO basically comes down to is creating <em>backlinks.</em></h2>
<p><strong>Directory listings, local citations, they&#8217;re all much the same when it comes to it.</strong></p>
<p>Backlinks help if they&#8217;re legitimate &#8211; which means someone likes your site and has a proper reason to link to it. Any attempt to manipulate your own link profile goes <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against Google&#8217;s guidelines</a> &#8211; and they&#8217;re adept at catching people and penalising them for it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2098" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png" alt="" width="440" height="145" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-240x79.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about this a number of times &#8211; <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/backlinks/">you can read some of those</a> if you&#8217;d like more information.</p>
<p>My approach to SEO is entirely Google friendly; I very much believe the best approach is to match the search engines&#8217; approach and fulfill their guidelines and recommendations.</p>
<p>This is sort of a catch-22, because while you shouldn&#8217;t fake links you do want them. My usual advice is to make use of your real life contacts to get some &#8211; ask suppliers or related sites to link to you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I should add too when people DO get links without properly asking people they really know for them &#8211; they tend to get extremely low quality ones. Too many low quality links hurts rather than helps. For example, every single person I&#8217;ve ever seen selling a <em>BBC, Apple</em> or <em>Huffington Post</em> link are actually just creating user profiles on those systems and sticking URLs in the bio section of those profiles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really a proper link on the BBC! People think they&#8217;re going to get something in a news article, but more often than not they&#8217;re on pages Google doesn&#8217;t even index. The effect is people buy a back link on a &#8216;high quality domain&#8217; but don&#8217;t get any SEO authority for it at all.</p>
<p>The people selling these links aren&#8217;t even doing it manually. There are automated tools they use to create hundreds of links in a few minutes. <strong>Google is smarter than this.</strong></p>
<p>Because Google says explicitly that trying to manipulate your own link profile is against their terms there is no such thing as paying for <em>Google safe</em> links. It&#8217;s an oxymoron.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not very good at tooting my own horn, but for the record, there are over 1,000 reviews of my service floating around on the internet, an 998 of those are 5-star feedbacks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing website development since 1995, and SEO since 1998. Even according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwell-explains-the-10000-hour-rule-2014-6?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s 10,000 hour</a>Â rule, that makes me an expert in both areas a few times over.</p>
<p>I just had a moment this morning that reminded myself just how experienced I am what I do. One clientÂ signed up for my <a href="https://peterwm.com/monthly-wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">monthly SEO service</a> a few weeks ago. Normally it&#8217;s a month before I issue the first update but I do like to keep an eye on how things are going and check the data fairly regularly.</p>
<p>So when he wrote to ask how things were progressing I was very happy to be able to send him this graph, showing the number of times his site was seen in Google search results over the past 90 days, with a crudely drawn arrow indicating when he started working with me.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1651" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/great-monhtly-seo-440x134.png" alt="Great Monthly SEO Service" width="440" height="134" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/great-monhtly-seo-440x134.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/great-monhtly-seo-240x73.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/great-monhtly-seo.png 949w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>So how good am I? Very good. I&#8217;m just not always very good at telling you about it.</p>

<p>Your Facebook Page needs to carry a LOT of important messages about you in just a couple of graphics. Too many people just shove their corporate logo up as their Page&#8217;s profile pic, and some large photo they like as the cover image. And certainly sometimes that can be the best option, but in most cases, it&#8217;s a wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>Who are you? Who is your target market? What sort of ethos do you and your business wnat to foster?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t tell people who you are you leave them free reign to form their own ideas about you and your business.</p>
<p>Seriously take a look at your Facebook Page right now. What does it show, at-a-glance, about you and your company?</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t say as much as it could, <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com/hourlie/design-your-facebook-page-for-you/33448" target="_blank">hire me for the ridiculously low sum of Â£19 to sort it out for you.</a></p>

Reinforcing your messages, your values, who you are and what you do.</p>
<p>Each page, every blog post, should help strengthen those key messages.</p>
<p>When we stop thinking about SEO in terms of its technical aspects, and instead see it as a form of communicating and interacting, it becomes both easier to understand, and perhaps more importantly we can start to slot it in with the rest of our business plans.</p>
<p>Almost everything we do in every aspect of our lives (including work!) is about the interplay between people. If we can find a way to see more of the processes we invest our energy and time in in those terms, then a cohesive model starts to emerge.</p>

<p>Youtube is often overlooked as a social network for business, when in fact it&#8217;s one of the easiest ways to build your authority in your industry.</p>
<p>If you only post a two minute video clip a week, it&#8217;s still faster than blogging, and helps sell you as a person, your brand benefits, your exposure goes way up, and it&#8217;s a great way to build your audience.</p>
<p>And with the comments sections and embedding links in videos back to your site, it has the social interaction aspect that you need to be communicating with your clients.</p>
<p>The other big point of difference? Most people have Twitter and Facebook Pages. They&#8217;re still incredibly valuable, but Youtube videos are a simple way to set yourself apart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-766" title="facebook insights, social networking, seo" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/facebook-insights-social-networking-seo-150x150.png" alt="Facebook insights, Social Networking, SEO" width="150" height="150" />Social networking is much more than an SEO technique. And while the point of <a title="Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), a primer" href="https://peterwm.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo-a-primer/">this series</a> is to focus on improving your search engine ranking and visibility, it would be reductionist (and actually really difficult) to talk about social media and it&#8217;s relationship to your business without discussing community.</p>
<p>After all, as important as SEO is, its purpose is to build your community of clients, and therefore that tribe of people is the most important thing.</p>
<p>While previous posts in this series focussed on a number of different things you can do, with this topic it all runs together and is a more conceptual dialogue.</p>
<h2>Backlinks</h2>
<p>At its simplest, the explanation of a backlink is, well, simple. Search engines scan social networks and basically count all the links to articles and content on other sites. If you have 50 links back to one article you wrote, you&#8217;ll be seen as having more authority than a site which only gets five.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that social backlinks are given a fairly low importance by the big search engines, so unsurprisingly a link to your post from an article on The Guardian website carries a lot more gravitas. More on that in the next point.</p>
<p>They are however very useful, because they do offer some weight to your content, and it&#8217;s very easy to share content on social media. You&#8217;ll notice at the end of all my blog posts is a share featureâ€”I click all those buttons myself to share my content. It&#8217;s the easiest way.</p>
<h2>Photos/graphics/images</h2>
<p>Before you share your article, make sure it has an image as part of it. Facebook and Linkedin both include a graphic from your content next to the link, and links with images get more clicks. Simple.</p>
<p>A word of advice here from personal experienceâ€”make sure you have an image in place before you even try to share your content via Facebook once, even if it&#8217;s just a test. Facebook caches the content on links, so if you post once without a graphic and then you remember that you really should have included one so you go back and edit your post then share againâ€”Facebook is probably not going to bother looking for any changes. And you&#8217;re stuck with a text-only link.</p>
<h2>Social networks</h2>
<p>You have a bunch of options for places to post to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook is a no-brainer. Have a page on it, and post your content to it. Make sure the privacy for your posts is &#8220;public&#8221;, and even if you have very few &#8220;likes&#8221;, at least the backlinks are there.</li>
<li>Twitter is a no-brainer. It&#8217;s short, simple, scanned by Google in near real-time, and again, even if you have very few interactions on that network the links to your content exist.</li>
<li>Linkedin is, for almost every professional business, a no-brainer. It&#8217;s where professionals find each other, discuss their industries, and again, if nothing else you&#8217;ve got links back to your content.</li>
<li>Blogs<em> should</em> be a no-brainer. Their potential as social networking is often overlooked, but those comments sections are valuable. Read an article, a few of the comments, then post your own reply with a link to your site. Backlinks ahoy. I include online newspapers and the link as blogs for this purpose; they&#8217;re <em>very</em> widely read. Here&#8217;s a top tip. Once a week, read a really popular blog about your industry. Take 10 minutes to write your own thoughts on the subject, and post that to <strong>your</strong> blog. Then comment on the industry blog saying, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve been thinking about this a lot too, and here&#8217;s my recent blog post that might help enlighten things.&#8221; Boom. Your traffic goes up, and you have original content linked to on a popular siteâ€”it doesn&#8217;t matter that you did it yourself.</li>
<li>Tumblr is a great one too. We&#8217;re now in the realm of the networks I call &#8220;time-allowing&#8221;, because while it&#8217;d be nice to hit up every network out there, I also hope you&#8217;re busy making money. But this is worth having a presence on, and sharing your ideas through.</li>
<li>Google+ (a.k.a. Google Plus). I use it because funnily enough, Google search knows what&#8217;s happening on its own social network. I haven&#8217;t made much of setting up my Google+ presence yet simply because there are so many hours in the week. However, I still think this network shows promise for really taking off, and if it does, I want to be established there while other people are playing catch up.</li>
<li>Digg, StumbleUpon, Reddit, Delicious. They&#8217;re all worth a go, and are essentially social bookmarking services. People share bookmarks, rate them up or down, that kind of thing. The one to be slightly wary of is Reddit thoughâ€”while it can drive some serious traffic to your site, they have a very close-knit community of users; and if they grab hold of content they don&#8217;t like for one reason or another they will tear it to shreds. And with it your ego.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>This is really important, because it&#8217;s not just backlinks that you want, it&#8217;s to have people taking about them, interacting, and ultimately sharing themselves. That in turn brings other people in, and before you know it you have a community of people to sell to. And this is of course the desirable ultimate result.</p>
<p>But people won&#8217;t share content unless it&#8217;s right in their faces, and of interest to them. And also importantly, of perceived interest to their friends. People don&#8217;t share content on social networks because <em>they</em> think it&#8217;s awesome, they share it because they think <em>their friends</em> will think it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s an important distinction.</p>
<p>Part of this community building is for you to interact with your followers and subscribers. If someone looks like they want to get into a debate, then engage with that. If they retweet something you&#8217;ve written, thank them for it. Make them feel included and valued by you. Don&#8217;t leave other people&#8217;s comments hanging out at the tail end of your posts, reply.</p>
<p>Also consider the nature of a community. If all you ever post is backlinks, people will start to overlook your social content. Twitter is a great example, it&#8217;s a very social, social network. Because it&#8217;s so quick to post to, and users expect a fair quantity of tweets to be made by other users, ideally you&#8217;ll post a couple of times a day with something humorous, or clever, or an original inspiring thought, and perhaps post backlinks three times a week. With this sort of ratio you&#8217;re building your community and adding weight to your links.</p>
<h2>Find opinion leaders</h2>
<p>Within any grouping of people, there are those who the rest look up to, and value their opinions. These are the people who naturally settled into a position at the top of the pack, and set the tone for how people interact, what sorts of things they share, but most importantly decide what will be valued by the group. Marketers are always trying to find these people and to get them onside. Have you ever seen those giveaways on Facebook where if you share an advert, and get the most &#8220;likes&#8221; for it, you win something? Well those campaigns aren&#8217;t just about getting brands shared about, they also allow the marketers to see who gets the most likesâ€”and these are the opinion leaders they know to target their advertising towards in future.</p>
<p>My wife is an opinion leader amongst her peers. Whenever she comments on one of my Facebook page&#8217;s posts, or shares it with her friends, that post reaches about five times as many people as a normal one.</p>
<p>Opinion leaders make your shares, backlinks, and social communities much more effective. And bear in mind you want to be one of these people yourself. The go-to-person for a section of your industry. Experts and gurus are opinion leaders.</p>
<p>So start acting like one. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

Like showing right there in its results the dates and venues of a company&#8217;s upcoming events?</p>
<p>Well, that used to be done via little code tags in your HTML. Over the last few months, Google has rolled out a tool to let you do it across your entire site by previewing your live site graphically, and simply highlighting parts of it.</p>
<p>Those snippets in the results carry a lot of weight; people assume that the sites with snippets are for the more popular and professional businesses.</p>
<p>Make the most of this TODAY. (That&#8217;s right, I used CAPS. This is so simple and such a great upgrade to your Google presence!)</p>
