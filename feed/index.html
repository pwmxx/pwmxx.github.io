										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hi Peter</p>
<p>thanks for that advice. I&#8217;ll look into int. I was just looking at Google Console and noticed that in the &#8216;Coverage&#8217; section there are a few URLs marked &#8216;noindex&#8217; &#8211; do we need to worry about this in terms of it negatively impacts our SEO or anything else?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for checking &#8211; those are all pages we want marked as noindex!</p>
<p>They&#8217;re the &#8216;Stock&#8217; pages I referred to in my initial report when I delivered your SEO. In this case they are all just policy pages, terms &amp; conditions and cookie policy pages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll re-paste that section at the bottom of this message in case that&#8217;s helpful.</p>
<p>The reason they&#8217;re marked as &#8216;submitted but not indexed&#8217; is because they <strong>used</strong> to be submitted before I marked them otherwise. So really this is just Google letting you know about that change &#8211; eventually they&#8217;ll stop reporting these because they&#8217;ll see they are in fact <strong>not</strong> being submitted anymore.</p>
<p>I hope that&#8217;s helpful!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

A couple of pages on your site were &#8220;stock&#8221; pages, for example policy information. In order to make sure your site is compliant with the latest Google update, these were marked as &#8220;noindex&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason those sorts of pages are considered &#8220;stock&#8221; is they&#8217;re essentially standard pages (also known as &#8216;boilerplate&#8217;) that don&#8217;t reflect what your site is actually about.</p>
<p>A lot of sites use standard content for those, copied and pasted from elsewhere. So there can be duplicate content issues &#8211; but at the very least they don&#8217;t reflect the main purpose of your site, so they water down the message so-to-speak.</p>
<p>Google and Bing both recommend these sorts of pages be marked as &#8220;noindex&#8221;, meaning they won&#8217;t scan them and add them to the body of data about your site.</p>

<p>Page titles, Keywords, Description</p>
<p>What your turnaround at present?</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me, it&#8217;s great to hear from you again.</p>
<p>My turnaround is the usual up-to-three business days.</p>
<p>Your other questions actually have quite a bit to unpack though. So I&#8217;ll go through them all in turn.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
Up to 40 pages per site is usually considered fair. But that just refers to the number of pages you might want to have tags crafted for manually. You don&#8217;t always want that for all types of content.</p>
<p>So, the main pages on a site should always have manually strategised and written tags. But the same isn&#8217;t always true for other types of content. Sometimes for posts, and nearly always for products, you want those to be created on-the-fly (when a visitor loads the page) based on a series of rules, or schemas, that Google recommends.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for that, but the two main ones are:</p>
<p><em>AUTOPILOT</em><br />
When those more dynamic content types can be set up to create tags for you, it saves you having to worry about that going forward. You&#8217;re free to focus on creating new content, posts, products, etc.</p>
<p><em>RELEVANCY</em><br />
This is the biggie. Google cares a lot about the &#8216;relevancy&#8217; of your SEO settings and tags. Does the content in the tags match the content on the page? This sort of setup gives a 100% relevancy for description tags which is awesome.</p>
<p>And of course search engines don&#8217;t just judge each page by itself, they look at the site as a whole and ascribe SEO authority to the domain too.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s imagine a site has 10 static &#8216;Pages&#8217; in WordPress, but 100 &#8216;Posts&#8217;. If all those posts have a full, 100% relevancy score then we have a bit more leeway with the main Pages. So we can make them more keyword rich without risking triggering a &#8216;lack of relevance&#8217; problem.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
On to keywords. Those keyword meta tags haven&#8217;t been used in a very long time, well over a decade. Google confirmed in 2009 they didn&#8217;t (and hadn&#8217;t) used them:<br />
<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html</a></p>
<p>Bing never used that tag, and Yahoo stopped around ten years ago.</p>
<p>In fact while the Yoast SEO plugin does have an option to use keyword meta tags, but it actually has a comment next to the option:<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of any reason you&#8217;d want to use this.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even strong evidence (from Bing) that using them incorrectly will get you penalised!</p>
<p>It can be confusing because in the industry people do still talk about keywords, but they mean it in a different context. You can read about that here:<br />
<a href="https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/">https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s rather a lot of information about on-page SEO &#8211; but I hope it&#8217;s helpful!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I run a small design agency and looking for someone to help integrate good SEO practice into the new website for my client.</p>
<p>Someone is working on the messaging and content for the client and I will be working on the front end design and branding. We will probably be going for a WordPress based theme.</p>
<p>I had a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any ongoing monthly fees?</li>
<li>Do you integrate Google Search Console?</li>
<li>Do you use Yoast or Rankmath?</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you need more detail about the client/website before getting started?</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>I have a few <em>answers</em> for you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
I do offer an ongoing SEO campaign option &#8211; many people are perfectly happy with the one-time overhaul and the fee for that &#8211; but clients that really want to commit to SEO (which is hands down the best, cheapest marketing you can do) will usually carry on.</p>
<p>I actually throw in a free month of that service too, so people can see the value first-hand.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
Yes, absolutely. Google Search Console is the authoritative place for Google&#8217;s organic search statistics. It&#8217;s a vital tool for anyone working in SEO.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong><br />
Actually, I choose the plugin based on several factors with the site itself. Different plugins are best for different websites&#8211;the way you&#8217;re using pages, posts etc is important in deciding. I don&#8217;t have a favourite, I like to look at a site and decide which plugin would be best for it on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Something I can say though is in about 80% of cases All In One SEO pack ends up being selected.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally)</strong><br />
The best time to engage me is immediately after the site has gone live. That way I can do all the various submission processes alongside the search engine optimisation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big believer that all information is good information &#8211; so if you wanted to send through more info on the client that would be welcome. But it&#8217;s also true the current content I can see I believe gives me more than enough information about her to base the work on.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

2. SEO audit &amp; recommendations<br />
3. SEO optimisation</p>
<p>I think 2 &amp; 3 are covered in your offer here. Can you also help with 1?<br />
I think I already have most of the set up bit in place (site map, SEO pack etc).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>I have a few thoughts around this&#8230;</p>
<p>1)<br />
I don&#8217;t do speed work by itself anymore &#8211; only bundled with SEO. I can probably make the site faster &#8211; I usually achieve around an 35-40% increase in loading time (I can&#8217;t make promises of course!) but because your iste currently loads in around 6 seconds that&#8217;s still not going to be terribly fast.</p>
<p>You can see from the attached benchmark in the &#8216;File Requests&#8217; graph towards the bottom that the thing taking most of the loading time is actually just the very first &#8216;connection&#8217; bit. That suggests it could be a problem with the server causing the slowdown, not the site, which I wouldn&#8217;t be able to resolve for you.</p>
<p>2)<br />
Your SEO could do with an overhaul to be honest. Just looking at something as basic as the homepage description it&#8217;s already breaking one of the main rules &#8211; it has too many commas. Too many of those and Google assume you&#8217;re just keyword stuffing. Which to be fair is what you&#8217;re doing here.</p>
<p>So I can certainly overhaul your SEO, and look to improve the loading time as part of the job with the add-on.</p>
<p>Up to you obviously! Thanks again,</p>

<p>Thanks for contacting me. It&#8217;s always good to be recommended!</p>
<p>My offer would be appropriate for your site: you don&#8217;t have a lot of SEO work on there currently so it would certainly make a difference.</p>
<p>A few general thoughts:</p>
<p>1)<br />
Your homepage is a bit light on text. Personally I&#8217;d recommend you rewrite the main About page text (to ensure it&#8217;s unique) and include that on the homepage too. If that isn&#8217;t feasible I&#8217;d suggest moving the main About page text to the homepage instead.</p>
<p>2)<br />
It&#8217;s good you have active social media accounts. They can work well for social related traffic to your site (when you link from them to pages on the site) but actually have very little SEO impact. Facebook for example has marked all their outbound links as &#8216;nofollow&#8217; for some years. So links don&#8217;t count towards your SEO authority. In my experience social accounts are best used to create a mini &#8216;community&#8217; on those platforms you can have your own specific strategies for.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I had a client recently who (for reasons exclusively to do with the inexperience of their website&#8217;s designer) turned off one of the SEO plugins I had installed and configured for them.</h2>
<p><strong>It happened shortly after I carried out an <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/" title="Wordpress SEO overhaul work">initial SEO overhaul</a> on their site, so gives us a valuable insight into the effect of getting SEO done, and the removing it again.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2364" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png" alt="" width="440" height="132" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-240x72.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-768x230.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very small (and brand new company), but you can see the effects in this graph &#8211; taken directly from Google Search Console.</p>
<p>Initially after my work their SEO stats began to shoot up, gaining traction and upward momentum. Immediately after deactivating just one plugin it plummeted back to its original position.</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t use to happen so quickly. If you took SEO work off a site, or just fell behind with updates and changes to best practice, things would trail off over time. It now appears not having the very best SEO at all times leads to an immediate decrease in SEO authority. Because so many website owners (your competitors!) invest in SEO these days it means any time you don&#8217;t have it working, they can rise above you in the rankings.</p>
<p>But other SEO professionals have tried the same thing (turning off a single SEO plugin on their own testing sites) and see the same result. <em>The drop is nearly immediate.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Please remember when saving images to upload to the web &#8211; photos should be saved as JPGs.</h2>
<p><strong>PNG is another popular format for the web but it works best on images like logos, with large blocks of the same colour.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2359" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-440x231.png" alt="" width="440" height="231" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-440x231.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-240x126.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-600x315.png 600w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-768x403.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos.png 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Anything like a photograph that is made up of 1000s of different colours will always be best as a JPG &#8211; and usually about one 10th the filesize.</p>
<p>Of the clients that ask me to speed up their WordPress websites (in addition to their <a title="Wordpress SEO" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">SEO work</a>) perhaps the most improvement comes from simply converting their photos they&#8217;ve saved as PNGs into JPGs. If a site has several photos that are saved as the wrong file type it&#8217;s easy to shave several megabytes off the page size, and therefore speed up the site&#8217;s loading time.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is a lot of software for editing images will default to PNG when you use their &#8220;Save for web&#8221; function. Which is fine for icons and logos, charts and even text saved as an image.</p>
<p>So many websites these days focus on really high quality imagery (understandably &#8211; people <em>love</em> photographs!) but don&#8217;t know that not all file types are created equally, they all have different purposes and use cases and those wonderful product shots should <strong>always</strong> be saved as JPGs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to get in the habit of doing this right away &#8211; after an image is uploaded into WordPress there&#8217;s no simply way to convert it to JPG and change all the references in the code to use the different filename. So try to get it right from the outset!</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2322" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>If we go back several years to what was a very big announcement from Google &#8211; they turned on something they called RankBrain. At the time it was a new system and approach to search engine optimisation. They were using artificial intelligence to try to read webpages more like a human (actual visitors) would.</p>
<p>It was such a big deal because context suddenly became very important. The days of simply matching how many times you used certain keywords in your content against searches were over &#8211; it was crucial to write informative, useful content.</p>
<p>(That seems like a non-brainer anyway &#8211; content should always be useful and informative.)</p>
<p>But it was the beginning of the end for the concept of &#8216;how many keywords you can rank for&#8217;, or &#8216;just say this three times and you&#8217;ll rank really highly&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the years following Google has made all kinds of similar small updates to improve that system. They&#8217;re committed to returning useful well-written, informative results; and they&#8217;ve regularly made changes to their algorithm to further that aim.</p>
<h3>The BERT SEO update</h3>
<p>The BERT update really just pushes that to the next level. &#8216;Pattern matching&#8217; for specific phrases isn&#8217;t enough anymore, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is all in line with what I&#8217;ve been saying for years &#8211; don&#8217;t just write to specific words (whether they&#8217;re &#8216;long tail&#8217; or something else, the concept of expecting a certain amount of repetition to rock your SEO isn&#8217;t valid) &#8211; rather write well thought out content that explains what you&#8217;re trying to say.</p>
<p>(This is why some of the recent news stories about BERT backtracked about how important it was &#8211; because while it <strong>is</strong> important &#8211; it&#8217;s just a continuation of the same direction Google&#8217;s been going for a long time.)</p>
<p>To give you an example. You&#8217;d think the key with my own site is to mention <em>SEO</em> a lot. That&#8217;s easy to do &#8211; but harder to do in a way that makes it clear to the reader that I&#8217;m an authority on the subject, and even harder to impart useful information that might entice people back to my blog.</p>
<p>Simply repeating keywords is essentially keyword stuffing and Google knows it.</p>
<p>My recommendation for writing content hasn&#8217;t changed. Write to your audience, not to search engines. If you&#8217;re writing an about page then write about what you do and how you help people. Useful, natural words and phrases will come out of that anyway.</p>
<p>Your visitors &#8211; and increasingly your search engine ranking &#8211; will thank you for it.</p>
<h3>Why context matters so much for SEO</h3>
<p>As search engines continue to prepare for voice search being used more often (voice searches are usually quite conversational in their wording) context becomes more important.</p>
<p>To give a really basically example, let&#8217;s think about a site that may have been a review for a florist. Even if the content said something negative, for example &#8220;What a rubbish florist&#8221;, previously it would have helped rank for the search query &#8216;florist&#8217;. Increasingly Google can understand the negativity there and is less likely to present that site to someone who clearly wants to find a reputable local florist.</p>
<p>That really is a very basic example, but context is <em>so</em> important.</p>
<h3>What needs changing for your WordPress SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">As a WordPress SEO expert</a> every change and update to SEO algorithms always comes back to the same question, &#8220;How does this impact WordPress SEO?&#8221; The answer in this case is <em>very little.</em> <a href="https://peterwm.com/homepage-faq-structured-data-to-improve-your-seo-rank/">Unlike structured data</a> or other updates that necessitate coding changes to your site, this really is all about content.</p>
<p>Fortunately WordPress itself is all about content and the ease of editing or creating it &#8211; so that&#8217;s a real boon. It&#8217;s easy to edit your site&#8217;s content to make it as contextual, human readable and useful as possible.</p>
<p>But there is no immediate need to jump in add or remove any plugins or systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>This is a creative use of Google Search Console I&#8217;ve come up with for some easy SEO wins</h2>
<p><strong>And it&#8217;s been working really well on all my testing sites.</strong></p>
<p>Google Search Console (GSC) is Google&#8217;s official stats system for organic search, and has the most useful data about your site&#8217;s ranking, visits, clicks, etc.</p>
<p>They changed the interface for it some time ago and keep adding more data in it. One new page will show you all the pages in your site they&#8217;ve crawled, but chosen <strong>not</strong> to include in search results.</p>
<p>So they know about these pages, but don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth including in their results pages. The effect of that is these pages are <em>not</em> actually helping with your SEO at all. From an SEO viewpoint they may as well not be there.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons I&#8217;ve found why otherwise useful content is being ignored by Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s just too short</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not on-topic enough</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your content might just be too short</h3>
<p>This is fairly self-explanatory. Unless you&#8217;ve got 300+ words of text on a page it will often be ignored.</p>
<h3>Your content might not be on-topic <em>enough</em></h3>
<p>The best way to explain this is with an example, let&#8217;s think about a digital marketing firm. Perhaps when they started they offered a variety of services from social media content to web development and SEO.</p>
<p>Well now they just focus on the latter. Their homepage is about it, all their services pages are too &#8211; but they have old blog posts about their older services.</p>
<p>Google knows what a site&#8217;s core service offering is. And things that might fall outside that &#8211; either because they&#8217;re just off topic or simply old and reflect what a business *used* to be about &#8211; they&#8217;re likely to get ignored as well.</p>
<h3>Re-purpose old content to get it indexed and working for your SEO!</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s my recommendation. Have a look through the list of crawled but not indexed pages and see if there are any you can fix.</p>
<p>Doing this myself I found any short pages I fleshed out, or outdated ones I re-tooled to reflect what I&#8217;m doing now &#8211; every single one got picked up again by Google.</p>
<p>In some cases it was just a matter of adding an extra paragraph to an existing post. That&#8217;s not nearly as cumbersome as writing an entirely new one but essentially gets a whole extra page indexed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Using FAQs on your site to get extra traffic from search results</h2>
<p><strong>Google loves a good Q&amp;A, and they&#8217;re great for your search engine optimisation.</strong></p>
<p>This is an excellent technique that Google has been responding to very positively recently. It involves a fairly interesting type of structured data.</p>
<p>Structured data is a series of tags and what&#8217;s known as <em>microdata</em> that Google, Bing and Yahoo all use to work out what content on your site matches specific, common types of information like phone numbers. It primarily sits in your pages&#8217; code &#8211; it&#8217;s not something the user sees directly. Although in the case of FAQs you do want them to be able to see them as well &#8211; that way your front-end information matches what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes. Google definitely wants to see that the information you&#8217;re supplying <em>them</em> is also what you&#8217;re giving to your <em>users.</em></p>
<p>You may have noticed little &#8216;People also ask&#8217; <em>click-to-open</em> sections like this on Google results pages before:</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-2297 alignnone" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png" alt="" width="440" height="316" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-240x173.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation.png 658w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Those questions and answers are being pulled from web pages with &#8216;FAQ&#8217; structured data on their homepages.</p>
<p>This technique involves adding an FAQ section to your own homepage, and then having the appropriate code added to those so Google can pick them up correctly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried this with a handful of clients and most have seen a 3-4 ranking place increase as a result! Even if Google doesn&#8217;t end up using your FAQs on their results page, the effect is the same; they just like to see the code in place.</p>
<p>So this is well worth implementing as part of your SEO strategy.</p>
<p>When writing FAQs for this purpose though it&#8217;s best to make them somewhat generic &#8211; they should be about your industry generally rather than about your specific offering. (If you take a look at the ones I wrote <a href="https://peterwm.com/">on my own homepage,</a> you&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re <em>predominantly</em> about SEO and it&#8217;s advantages rather than being about the services I offer myself.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like me to implement this for you <a href="mailto:peter@webcraft.co">please just get in touch</a> &#8211; and of course I can do it all for you as part of <a href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">an ongoing SEO campaign too.</a></p>
