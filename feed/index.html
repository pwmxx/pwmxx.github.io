<p>You can actually type anything in the All In One title box for a page or post and it will use that instead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2699" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/set-title-tags-seo-wordpress-440x119.png" alt="" width="440" height="119" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/set-title-tags-seo-wordpress-440x119.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/set-title-tags-seo-wordpress-240x65.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/set-title-tags-seo-wordpress-768x208.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/set-title-tags-seo-wordpress.png 999w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>It will still append &#8221; | <em>Your Business Name</em>&#8221; to the end though.</p>
<p>Do bear in mind that there&#8217;s a trade-off here in some regards. Google definitely prefers to see the title tag match the title of the article/page. There is some wiggle room, but as much as possible it should match, or at least have lots of the same words as the page title (ideally in the same order, you get the idea &#8211; they prefer it match).</p>
<p>Now that might not always be best to entice users to click on a search result. Absolutely.</p>
<p>So sometimes it might be best that they are different. But if they&#8217;re <em>TOO</em> different the page might not rank as well, losing potential visitors in the first place.</p>
<p>My question would be this &#8211; is there a reason the page&#8217;s title isn&#8217;t the same as the text you believe will entice clicks in the first place? If they&#8217;re changed to that then the page&#8217;s title and the title meta tag match, you get the clicks and Google is happy too.</p>

So they have separate 1 page websites for each location and also a group website &#8211; so 4 sites in total!</p>
<p>What is the most effective and efficient way to boost their SEO??! They&#8217;ve obviously been hit hard financially over the past 6 months and have asked me to help them build their online presence.</p>
<p>Your challenge, should you wish to accept, is&#8230; what is the best SEO strategy for them? Should we focus on one site and push out from there? Do all sites need separate focus?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like your services on this account on an ongoing monthly basis, but as mentioned, for now I need to find the most cost effective solution for them.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, so there&#8217;s a few options here. In a perfect world I&#8217;d SEO all four of them, and do campaigns on them all too. But obviously the budgetary constraints and the pandemic make this unlikely.</p>
<p>The lower end of things would be to have me just SEO and work in an ongoing capacity on one site.</p>
<p>I would propose a middle ground. That I do an initial SEO overhaul on them all (I&#8217;ll do 4 for the price of 3) and then choose one for an ongoing campaign. The one I would choose wouldn&#8217;t be the group site actually (simply because there&#8217;s not a lot on it, and also doing one of the locations might help prove to them the value of having other locations engage in a campaign too.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the main location one would be a good site to start <a title="An ongoing WordPress SEO campaign" href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">an ongoing SEO campaign</a> on.</p>

<p>We have just had one of our tech guys do something on the backend of the GRV site and they mentioned the following:</p>
<p>It looks like the site was running Yoast SEO and this has been removed and replaced with All In One SEO plugin. I would advise that this is changed back, as Yoast SEO is a much better plugin for SEO. The site also seems to be running a lot of unused plugins, so needs a proper tidy up. Plus a number of other SEO issues in regards to indexibility, etc.</p>
<p>Is this something that you are able to do or is there a reason that this is like it is?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a classic case of <em>it&#8217;s best to leave the specialist function to the specialist.</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Different WordPress SEO plugins are best in different circumstances &#8212; the way the site uses pages, products, posts etc. is important in choosing. I don&#8217;t have a personal affinity to any of them; I look at a website and decide which SEO plugin would be better on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>We discussed this back when I first worked on the site actually. Also the proof is in the pudding, the SEO setup I&#8217;ve provided and have been working on is very successful, as demonstrated in the stats.</p>
<p>The idea that &#8216;one plugin is always best&#8217; really just shows someone&#8217;s read a couple of (often sponsored) blog posts but doesn&#8217;t deal with the actual intricacies of SEO.</p>
<p>As you know, my work is considered, data driven and each site is given it&#8217;s own strategy.</p>
<p>He did mention there&#8217;s a lot of plugins generally on the site that aren&#8217;t being used &#8211; I do agree that should be looked at. It&#8217;s not SEO related of course&#8230;but also as they tech person it would be his job to be managing unneeded plugins for you I imagine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Need some help with my website. I have had someone working on it for over 15mths now and she hasnâ€™t managed to get my site on page one locally or in the region she was looking to optimise me for (without speaking to me about it). In the last 3 weeks we have got on page 1 for a key term, but I checked today and we have dropped off the first page. Any other first page ranking are because of the work I personally did using the Yoast plugin.</p>
<p>I recently did a check on my website using a free SEO report tool and it came up with a host of issues. When I shared this with my current SEO person she told me that there is nothing she can do about it. I have a lot of keywords stuck on page 2/3/4/5 and they havenâ€™t moved for several months. Could you fix all this? How long would it take you and what would be the costs?</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess there&#8217;s a few different things to look at there.</p>
<p>I should add I don&#8217;t <strong>love</strong> automatic reports. They&#8217;re not without use entirely&#8211;but they tend to look at pages individually rather than the site holistically &#8211; and frankly are no match for a 20+ year professional having a manual look at everything. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>But,</em> it does sound like your current person&#8217;s excuse that she can&#8217;t effect anything in there just isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>You mention you&#8217;ve done work in Yoast yourself which is great (I&#8217;m always pleased to hear site owners are happy to roll up their sleeves and delve into SEO!) but I&#8217;ve had a look at the source code for your site and there&#8217;s a LOT of scope for improvement.</p>
<p>Some of it&#8217;s to do with the more obvious stuff, meta tags etc., but also little things add up to make a big SEO difference &#8211; you&#8217;re obviously based in the UK but the code gives the US as your locale.</p>
<p>Do you know what your SEO person has supposedly been doing for you?</p>
<p>In terms of where you&#8217;re currently ranked, I&#8217;d love to see the Google Search Console property for the site if that&#8217;s been setup. Hopefully that&#8217;s also where you&#8217;re getting your own ranking data?</p>
<p>So yes, I can definitely help.</p>
<p>In the first instance I&#8217;d recommend my initial full WordPress overhaul:<br />
<a title="Wordpress SEO expert overhaul" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/</a></p>
<p>And then move onto the ongoing campaign:<br />
<a title="Wordpress Google campaign" href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/</a></p>
<p>I do offer discounts on the latter if people pay six months up front too &#8211; in fact I offer a 33% discount on that currently.</p>
<p>As a professional obviously I can&#8217;t make promises about where you&#8217;ll be ranked after my work, because ultimately that&#8217;s up to the search engines. Also without seeing the Dashboard for the site, or proper stats from Search Console (and carrying out other functions of my SEO work, like competitor analysis) it&#8217;s really hard to say. I can tell you if you&#8217;ve been on page one for a key query, and have slipped to page two, page one should be achieve-able again within about three-four months.</p>
<p>I hope that all helps!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve had the below email from Google.<br />

<p>I have recently moved our sites to WPEngine, hopefully that hasn&#8217;t caused any problems <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p></blockquote>
<p>A server error (most like &#8216;500&#8217;) simply means the server isn&#8217;t working properly. Not that it&#8217;s down, but rather it&#8217;s got issues processing the site or page.</p>
<p>For example if PHP isn&#8217;t working, or there&#8217;s some code in the site that&#8217;s not functioning. Normally it means some kind of code on the site breaking things.</p>
<p>More often than not if you see it it&#8217;s going to apply to the whole site, so because the site is working I suspect it was a temporary hosting issue.</p>
<p>Actually strike that!</p>
<p>I had a look further, and it was only one page that returned the 5xx error, and it&#8217;s not actually a page! It&#8217;s your WordPress theme files directory; we don&#8217;t want that indexed anyway. Google shouldn&#8217;t be trying to scan it anyhow, so I&#8217;m marked the issue as &#8216;fixed&#8217; in Search Console.</p>
<p>(In short, it&#8217;s not a problem they can&#8217;t load it, but I&#8217;ve asked it to be cleared from Search Console just to stop you getting any other messages about it.)</p>

<p>I have a WordPress website which I am looking to renovate along side some SEO and PPC. Additionally I need to look at social media as a platform to show case information and projects.</p>
<p>I am looking for long term business relationships with continues growth. We want a proactive partner who can explain when and how to scale these campaigns to offer similar returns of investment.</p>
<p>You look credible and i wanted to reach out.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a look at the current SEO setup and there&#8217;s definitely room for improvement. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Currently (for example) the homepage description code says:<br />
&#8220;Looking for an honest, reliable, professional Electrician in the London or Surrey area? Visit our website for more information.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few rules that doesn&#8217;t conform to. You have two commas which is okay, albeit the maximum. There&#8217;s a question in there which is considered a no-no.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the only three words in there that actually get searched for are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrician</li>
<li>London</li>
<li>Surrey</li>
</ul>
<p>and only one of those relates to your actual service!</p>
<p>So I can absolutely help with your SEO.</p>
<p>You talked about renovating the site &#8211; if you mean you want a new design made that is something I can help with &#8211; but it would involve making a new site from scratch. (Obviously I do extensive SEO work, but I don&#8217;t make bespoke layout or design changes to existing sites I&#8217;m afraid.)</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t work with PPC or social media. I used to, but year&#8217;s ago decided to hone my offering to the service that overwhelmingly delivers clients the best return on their investment &#8211; search engine optimisation.</p>
<p>Just a bit more on my SEO campaign offering. You can read more about it here:<br />
<a title="Wordpress SEO Campaign" href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/</a></p>
<p>I do usually recommend clients buy and work with me on the initial full expert WordPress SEO overhaul first though:<br />
<a title="Expert WordPress SEO" href="https://peterwm.com/amp-speed-for-wordpress-seo/">https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/</a></p>
<p>So they can be sure they enjoy working with me.</p>
<p>I hope that&#8217;s all helpful!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hi Peter</p>
<p>Could I ask for a bit of advice&#8230;is there anything you know we can do to improve mobile speed fairly easily? A client of ours has noted a few reports which seem to flag up the site being slow (or poor) on mobile?</p>
<p>I think you may have installed the AMP plugin on other sites, is that the sort of thing I should be doing?<br />
https://en-gb.wordpress.org/<wbr />plugins/amp/</p>
<p>I will also be switching this site over to be hosted on WPEngine which I hope will help.</p></blockquote>
<p>WPEngine is better than most for speed.</p>
<p>The ultimate hosting solution for speed though is to use SpinupWP on a UK-based Digital Ocean droplet. That&#8217;s where I host my clients and it flies.</p>
<p>AMP is definitely a good idea &#8211; but does require some testing. You want to have it turned on for as many types of posts (pages, posts, portfolio, etc.) as possible &#8211; but very often that will cause display issues on those data types. So it takes a bit of testing and finessing.</p>
<p>Speed wise I recommend (and can deploy for you) the WP Rocket plugin.</p>
<p>Bear in mind though those speed tests can be a test problematic where they give % scores. Here&#8217;s some more information on that:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>Just to let you know that I will be making payment later, and I have been asked by the website guy to let you know to pause the SEO as they are making changes to the content etc.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to seeing how my rankings have increased, way back before I got you on board as my WordPress SEO expert the guy had me down as 49?? So be lovely to see if I am moving up the ladder please.</p>
<p>Can I see how the keywords are ranking and performing in a report?</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess there&#8217;s a few things here.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
Pausing the SEO work so often isn&#8217;t conducive to getting good results to be honest. Just because content is being changed isn&#8217;t usually a reason to pause, in fact it&#8217;s best to carry on so I can reprocess the work and strategy as and when it changes.</p>
<p>So for now I&#8217;ve paused, but all the stop/starting isn&#8217;t the best.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
So I did send the end of month report (along with the invoice). That&#8217;s for a full month of SEO work I carried out for you. I haven&#8217;t shared search rankings specifically yet for statistical reasons. So, I don&#8217;t know where you web guy gets his stats from (or why you&#8217;d ever just tell someone, <em>&#8216;you&#8217;re in #49&#8217;</em> &#8211; what for? Every search query has a different rank.)</p>
<p>I get all my rankings from the horses&#8217; mouth &#8211; Google&#8217;s official system.</p>
<p>The trouble is they&#8217;ve only just started reporting on that for you, and as such the impressions they&#8217;re basing it on are quite low &#8211; which means some of their rankings they provide for you could be statistically anomalous.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, for a search for something like <em>&#8216;life coach&#8217;</em> you don&#8217;t have a set ranking. Google personalises results &#8211; so you and I will see different results when searching for the same thing based on our search histories and location. If I lived near you and did that search I&#8217;d see you much higher than if I lived in, say, the USA.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one example. They personalise for 100s of reasons.</p>
<p>So for example right now they report you in #4 overall for that search. And actually that&#8217;s based on 89 searched performed which is pretty statistically sound.</p>
<p>But for, say, <em>&#8216;life coaches near me&#8217;</em> they have you in #1, but based on just 4 searches. 4 isn&#8217;t a very large sample to use, so I don&#8217;t like to report on it in case when they start including a higher volume it&#8217;s shown to have been wildly different.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of some of your current search queries they do have data on. The position is your average rank (because it&#8217;s an average, some have a single decimal place. But you should round that, so a ranking here of 12.2 is actually just 12 &#8211; at the top of the second page.)</p>
<p>Impressions functions as the sample size.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the data we have to date, but as I say, I&#8217;d prefer more figures from Google before I can confidently say &#8220;You&#8217;re in this ranking for these search keywords.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope that all makes sense!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I know in your monthly WordPress SEO reports you include statistics for clicks from search engines, the number times my site was seen in search engines &#8211; and of course search rankings. I note you include up to 12 rankings for different search queries &#8211; do you have different packages and options for that?</p>
<p>Do you only track 12 regardless of what package someone is on?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah! I thought we discussed this before, but perhaps not.</p>
<p>Have a read here about keywords:<br />
<a title="Search queries and search keywords for SEO explained" href="https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/">https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/</a></p>
<p>The key thing there is ANY words in your site can (and are!) picked up for ranking.</p>
<p>So my work doesn&#8217;t just &#8216;target&#8217; 12 queries. And it never has. I&#8217;m targeting every area, every service, and more things besides.</p>
<p>I simply TRACK just 12. I settled on that for a variety of reasons, from the amount of time it takes to track and report on them to requests from my clients &#8211; when I&#8217;ve experimented with say, the top 50 I found people stopped engaging with the reports (and therefore their own SEO) as much.</p>
<p>So my recommendation is to pick a spread of terms you want to rank for, so that we can see the general site-wide trend over time. Not just to focus on the core things you want to rank for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like me to come up with a bespoke reporting package for you though which does track every permutation you might like I can &#8211; I&#8217;ll just need to adjust the price accordingly.</p>

I know you&#8217;re something of a WordPress SEO expert. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m about to start adding/writing copy to each product I&#8217;m adding to the site.</p>
<p>I know you&#8217;ve set everything up for me already, but I&#8217;m wondering what I would need to do when writing to ensure results from my site move up to the top of the results when people search for particular products? Would it just be ensuring I reference key search terms in each short description?</p>
<p>And how might I integrate star ratings into my results in SERPs?</p>
<p>Happy to pay for additional work, I just need to understand what is achievable &#8211; so I ask for your patience as I try and cement my learning/reading</p></blockquote>
<p>Rightio&#8230; so from my perspective the next stage really would be to engage in anÂ <a title="Wordpress SEO campaign with SEO expert" href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">regular SEO campaign with me.</a></p>
<p>Short, free advice to your queries though would be&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Would it just be ensuring I reference key search terms in each short description?</em><br />
Yes, that&#8217;s important. Also try to make sure the name of the cheese appears on the page itself 3x.</p>
<p><em>How might I integrate star ratings into my results in SERPs?</em><br />
Reviews are based on a couple of different possibilities.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re supplied from structured data (special code) which can be generated either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually, with manual code places in each page. This though is time consuming.</li>
<li>Sites that use an ecommerce product plugin, like Woocommerce, can turn it on relatively easily. It would pull them from the reviews people leave on your site &#8211; because you do have Woocommerce.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that latter one seems the best option. Also, including this structured data usually gives a bit of an improvement to your SEO generally. But bear in mind that just because you have the code doesn&#8217;t mean Google will definitely show star ratings in your search results.</p>
<p>Ultimately that&#8217;s up to them.</p>
