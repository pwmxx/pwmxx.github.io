								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The correct approach to image tags may surprise you. Here&#8217;s a reminder about why they are best optimised using a plugin.</p>
<p>Because of the way WordPress evolved over time from a simple blogging tool to an advanced content management system, traditionally people have set alt &amp; title tags per image, using the media manager.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not best for SEO. Images should reinforce what the <strong>page</strong> is about, not <em>just</em> what the image is of.</p>
<p>To give an example, if you have one image that&#8217;s used on two pages, you might not want them to both have the same alt tags. So the systems I set up does an excellent job of setting those tags in the live code whenever a page is visited. It mixes the page title with the name of your site to make sure both your branding and (most importantly) what the page is actually about is being reinforced.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best approach for image tags and search engines.</p>
<p>(My favourite plugin for this is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pb-seo-friendly-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PB SEO Friendly Images.)</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>41% of adults search for something using voice at least once a day, and for young adults it&#8217;s over half! This applies to Google voice search, Alexa home devices, Siri&#8230;anything you can ask a question and expect a result.</p>
<p>The good news is the way we approach SEO for voice search hasn&#8217;t drastically differed.</p>
<p>Yes, voice searches tend to be longer and more conversational. And direct too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example, let&#8217;s say I want to know what the highest mountain is in the UK. Previously I might have entered <em>highest mountain uk</em> into a search engine.</p>
<p>But when asking a voice assistant, I&#8217;m more likely to say something along the lines of tell me <em>what is the highest mountain in the uk. </em>So it&#8217;s longer and more conversational. But despite its length it <strong>is</strong> more direct; I&#8217;m being clearer about what I want to know, which is what the highest one is.</p>
<p>That text search could bring up a page of results that list several high mountains, or articles that talk about a recent event or news story that took place on the highest mountain.</p>
<p>At this point in time search engines are taking these voice questions and dumbing them down for their own purposes. So when a voice search tool is actually working out what results to return, the example above could well be turned into that simpler 3-word version behind the scenes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really going to have an impact is when that directness starts to be factored in a lot more intuitively. Because at that point in time search will become less like looking up relevant information based on a subject (like an old encyclopedia) and more to do with answering really specific questions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very early days to think about how the approach we take to SEO might change when that happens. But the key will be in line with the major engines&#8217; existing ethos &#8211; your website should have a clear purpose, and be written in a natural human readable way so that visitors can easily find the information they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>And in that regard voice search is really just a continuation of the direction the search engines have been heading toward for well over a decade.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Far too many WordPress sites end up with empty social links</h2>
<p>I see this all the time; in the header or footer of WordPress sites, a series of little social media icons that links to &#8211; nothing.</p>
<p>A lot of WordPress themes have sections for you to fill out your social profiles, so those little buttons can link to them correctly. But a lot of those themes will show them regardless of whether or not you&#8217;ve entered proper URLs. Some go a step further, and by default will have a link entered as <em>#.</em> That just means it links back to the page you&#8217;re on, but it&#8217;s enough to get the buttons showing and essentially linking to nothing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy enough oversight to make. But it means you have dead links which isn&#8217;t great for your SEO, and if visitors notice then it just seems wildly unprofessional.</p>
<p>If you have social buttons, they really need to link to social sites. It&#8217;s not hard to do &#8211; these sorts of WordPress themes are intended to make everything as simple as possible &#8211; but at the very least have a quick check of your own site and make sure your social button links, well, <em>link.</em></p>
<p>In all honesty I see this in perhaps a third of WordPress sites overall, so there&#8217;s a good chance it affects your&#8217;s.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Searching for yourself is a terrible idea</h2>
<p>I still get asked a lot about discrepancies between what a client sees when they search for themselves, and either the official stats, or what their friend might see, etc.</p>
<p>So this is a refresher about why you shouldn&#8217;t search for yourself as a way to measure your ranking.</p>
<p>Google does all kinds of personalisation on your search results (based on your network&#8217;s IP address, if you&#8217;re logged into any Google accounts, even your location) and the more often you look for your own site, the more skewed those results will be.</p>
<p>To give an example, most people searching for &#8220;peter mahoney&#8221; see my site on the first page. But I see myself on the fourth. Essentially because I&#8217;ve searched for myself so often &#8211; and then not spent much time on my site or even bothered to click it &#8211; Google has &#8220;learnt&#8221; that I don&#8217;t like it and therefore ranks it down for me, uniquely.</p>
<p>The right place to get Google&#8217;s official rank for your site is their own monitoring systems, which is where I get my stats.</p>
<p>Their stats are actually an &#8216;average&#8217; of your rank which is the statistically most useful approach. Because of personalisation, not everyone sees your site in the same position. Where someone is searching from geographically for example has an impact. So the average rank is the best indicator of where you rank.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a commonly held belief that if you use a private browsing window somehow you&#8217;ll see the proper rankings in the search results. But all that does is prevent Google from knowing your account &#8211; they still know where you live, your IP address, in some cases the unique code for your network card &#8211; there&#8217;s *plenty* for them to skew your results with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google PageSpeed Insights has become a tad problematic of late.</h2>
<p>Firstly, Google PageSpeed is just a list of code changes that <em>might</em> improve your website&#8217;s speed. In most cases trying to do everything they list would simple break a WordPress website &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a matter of having to try lots or permutations of speed settings to see which scores best. So for example with a lot of themes if you minify javascript <strong>and</strong> defer scripts it it&#8217;ll break things, so we have to choose between those.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that when Google actually uses speed as a metric for your SEO ranking, they&#8217;re looking at the actual load time for the site as opposed to how it measures on the PageSpeed metric.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of why the % scores aren&#8217;t a great measure, let&#8217;s consider browser caching. We can&#8217;t change whether other domains have it or not. So if you reference any other scripts in your site, for example Facebook, we can&#8217;t affect that. And you&#8217;ll still fail for the &#8216;browser caching&#8217; section &#8211; even though it might already be applied to all your <em>own</em> scripts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great irony of PageSpeed that having Google Analytics installed on a site always costs it a few % points, for the same reason. You&#8217;d think Google could do better with their own systems.</p>
<p>Google also changed the way they display results recently and it&#8217;s made their reports far less useful for the majority of sites out there. They recommend you &#8216;Serve images in next-gen formats&#8217;, even though there&#8217;s a lack of cross-browser compatibility for them. (Yes, you can set things up with a fall back so if a visitor&#8217;s browser doesn&#8217;t support JPG 2000 it will show another image instead &#8211; but as yet this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;ll find commonly in WordPress themes. In fact I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s in any.)</p>
<p>So suddenly this testing tool is giving biased advice &#8211; guess which browser has full compatibility with next generation image formats? <strong>Google Chrome.</strong></p>
<p>Like most Google reporting, PageSpeed <em>does</em> give a good idea of possible things to investigate but it&#8217;s not worth getting so hung up on you stop focusing on your content creation.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a new force in Digital Marketing in New Zealand &#8211; which I may have more than a little to do with.</p>
<p>As an ex-New Zealander I still like to keep myself appraised of what&#8217;s going on down there, and have decided to throw my hat in their digital marketing ring. People who have worked with me before will know I work a little differently:</p>
<p><em>No nonsense, up front pricing, and everything delivered on time and on budget.</em></p>
<p>And every market needs a company like that!</p>
<p>🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://pwm.nz">Purple Web Marketing in NZ</a> is a new company I&#8217;ll be overseeing, but it&#8217;s a team effort rather than just myself. I&#8217;ve been using contractors to help out as the business has grown, but it&#8217;s time to call a spade a spade and say it&#8217;s a proper agency.</p>
<p>The UK business will be brought up to speed as well in the next few weeks, becoming the UK headquarters for Purple Web Marketing. So make the most of this black website while you can &#8211; it&#8217;s all going very purple very soon.</p>
<p>I remember at high school a guidance counselor once promised that &#8220;one day, we&#8217;ll all be working remotely from anywhere in the world!&#8221; and I&#8217;m pleased to say she was right. You&#8217;ll find me all over the place, working hard and delivering great results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome to 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually do resolutions or anything like that, but as this site is now a few years old it makes sense to resolve to make myself a new one.</p>
<p>It might take a bit longer than usual because I&#8217;ll be doing it all with a &#8220;static site generator&#8221;, which is simply a useful way to generate sites that don&#8217;t have really advanced features, like e-commerce. But it allows for blindingly fast sites (in fact they load about 4x faster than a WordPress site!) so is a good direction to head in.</p>
<p>Of course if you want a <a href="/wordpress-website-development/">new website for 2018,</a> or just to make sure your existing one <a href="/one-off-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">gets as many visitors as possible,</a> let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be here all year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img  title="Moving email between servers Peter Mahoney" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1762" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/move-email-between-servers-600x315.png"  alt="Moving email between servers Peter Mahoney"  width="600" height="315" />There are plenty of reason to move servers for your website, but email is often an afterthought. Even though it&#8217;s something we use hundreds of times a week.</p>
<p>Speed issues, cost and possibly (hopefully) needing to upgrade to cope with all your traffic are all excellent reasons to consider a server move.</p>
<p>Moving the website is one thing, files, databases and DNS work all need to be done &#8211; but what about all your emails? Inbox, folder, sent items, drafts. How do you get those across?</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a server admin with full control over them, then this post isn&#8217;t for you. Because you have some clear pathways to move email from the old server to the new one.</p>
<p>But what about everyone else? The 99% of people who just pay for shared space with an existing hosting company, who just have a web based control panel (like Plesk or cPanel) they log into?</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s you, prepare for pain. Well, to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Simply put there&#8217;s never been a decent tool made to move email from server to server.</p>
<p>If you connect to your email currently via POP, that will mean you&#8217;re downloading your email to you local computer and therefore have a local copy. So losing the email from the existing server wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
<p>If you connect via IMAP (and most people do) then all your email is stored on the server, and would be lost. In this case you have 3 courses of action*:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be prepared to lose your existing email.</li>
<li>Change it so you do connect via POP, then have all that email download to your local machine. The downside with this is usually you&#8217;d only end up with the emails on one machine. If you&#8217;re used to checking the same email accounts via perhaps two computers and a mobile, then you&#8217;d lose the option to have old emails on those.</li>
<li>Get the new server setup and running. Set up the new email address (using IMAP too) and get those all setup on your computer. Then connect to the old email accounts again (you&#8217;ll need to change the server address to the IP address, which is a tad cumbersome). But then the really awful bit comes in, you have to drag the emails from the old accounts to the new &#8211; and because they&#8217;re set up on your local machine it downloads them all then uploads them as it copies them across. Sometimes I can copy a folder at a time, sometimes you need to do emails one at a time &#8211; it depends on the setup of the old server.</li>
</ol>
<p>That last one is a horrible job. I&#8217;ve done it on request before, but for an average small office email setup it can easily take a day.</p>
<p>My preference is to start again. Suck up that there&#8217;s going to be email lost, make sure you have copies of any current message threads and communication, and bite the bullet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* = If you&#8217;re moving from one type of hosting control panel to another one that&#8217;s the same (for example cPanel to cPanel) &#8211; you have another option fortunately. Again it&#8217;s messy: you need to download your mail folder then recreate all the same email accounts on the new server and upload the mail folder to the same place on that new server. This often falls down though because of permissions issues, or server settings you can&#8217;t control (where mail is stored, etc.)</p>

<p>Over the past week I&#8217;ve seen more than my fair share of emails from Google regarding &#8220;<span class="il">Nonsecure</span> Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56&#8243;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big change, but not exactly a surprising one.</p>
<p>Google has been pushing to make the web more secure for a long time. Seeing HTTPS and green padlocks all over the web has been a key direction for them &#8211; they&#8217;ve even given secure sites a ranking boost as part of their algorithms. This new change is really an extension of their general SEO ethos.</p>
<p>So anyone running the latest version of Google&#8217;s Chrome Browser (version 56) will see a warning when browsing any web page that asks for sensitive information. The examples they&#8217;ve given are passwords or credit card details but undoubtedly there&#8217;s other situations a user would be presented with a warning too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been recommending web owners migrate to HTTPS for a few years, but now it&#8217;s become really important especially if you have any page users can log in through (including I expect WordPress Dashboard login pages like wp-login.php) or e-commerce.</p>
<p>These things may well be frustrating when they first crop up, requiring immediate changes to your website. But bear in mind Google has been open about their general desires for the web (that it be easy to find useful information, that it be secure, mobile friendly and fast) for a long time. So as long as you apply those same concepts to your own site as soon as you can then changes like this will actually put you ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>In case you know this impacts you but haven&#8217;t yet had the email from Google about it (or don&#8217;t use Google Search Console in which case you&#8217;d never get one) here is the text of their message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonsecure Collection of Passwords will trigger warnings in Chrome 56 for http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>To: owner of http://www.domain.com/</p>
<p>Beginning in January 2017, Chrome (version 56 and later) will mark pages that collect passwords or credit card details as “Not Secure” unless the pages are served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>The following URLs include input fields for passwords or credit card details that will trigger the new Chrome warning. Review these examples to see where these warnings will appear, and so you can take action to help protect users’ data. The list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>{examples are given here}</p>
<p>The new warning is the first stage of a long-term plan to mark all pages served over the non-encrypted HTTP protocol as “Not Secure”.</p></blockquote>
