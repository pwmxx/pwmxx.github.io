										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I know in your monthly WordPress SEO reports you include statistics for clicks from search engines, the number times my site was seen in search engines &#8211; and of course search rankings. I note you include up to 12 rankings for different search queries &#8211; do you have different packages and options for that?</p>
<p>Do you only track 12 regardless of what package someone is on?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah! I thought we discussed this before, but perhaps not.</p>
<p>Have a read here about keywords:<br />
<a title="Serach queries and search keywords for SEO explained" href="https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/">https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/</a></p>
<p>The key thing there is ANY words in your site can (and are!) picked up for ranking.</p>
<p>So my work doesn&#8217;t just &#8216;target&#8217; 12 queries. And it never has. I&#8217;m targeting every area, every service, and more things besides.</p>
<p>I simply TRACK just 12. I settled on that for a variety of reasons, from the amount of time it takes to track and report on them to requests from my clients &#8211; when I&#8217;ve experimented with say, the top 50 I found people stopped engaging with the reports (and therefore their own SEO) as much.</p>
<p>So my recommendation is to pick a spread of terms you want to rank for, so that we can see the general site-wide trend over time. Not just to focus on the core things you want to rank for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like me to come up with a bespoke reporting package for you though which does track every permutation you might like I can &#8211; I&#8217;ll just need to adjust the price accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Just thinking about the next stage for my WordPress SEO and how your expertise can help with that to get more visitors to the site. I know you&#8217;re something of a WordPress SEO expert. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m about to start adding/writing copy to each product I&#8217;m adding to the site.</p>
<p>I know you&#8217;ve set everything up for me already, but I&#8217;m wondering what I would need to do when writing to ensure results from my site move up to the top of the results when people search for particular products? Would it just be ensuring I reference key search terms in each short description?</p>
<p>And how might I integrate star ratings into my results in SERPs?</p>
<p>Happy to pay for additional work, I just need to understand what is achievable &#8211; so I ask for your patience as I try and cement my learning/reading</p></blockquote>
<p>Rightio&#8230; so from my perspective the next stage really would be to engage in anÂ <a title="Wordpress SEO campaign with SEO expert" href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">regular SEO campaign with me.</a></p>
<p>Short, free advice to your queries though would be&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Would it just be ensuring I reference key search terms in each short description?</em><br />
Yes, that&#8217;s important. Also try to make sure the name of the cheese appears on the page itself 3x.</p>
<p><em>How might I integrate star ratings into my results in SERPs?</em><br />
Reviews are based on a couple of different possibilities.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re supplied from structured data (special code) which can be generated either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually, with manual code places in each page. This though is time consuming.</li>
<li>Sites that use an ecommerce product plugin, like Woocommerce, can turn it on relatively easily. It would pull them from the reviews people leave on your site &#8211; because you do have Woocommerce.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that latter one seems the best option. Also, including this structured data usually gives a bit of an improvement to your SEO generally. But bear in mind that just because you have the code doesn&#8217;t mean Google will definitely show star ratings in your search results.</p>
<p>Ultimately that&#8217;s up to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hi Peter, that was fast work. Just got a couple of questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>How do i set keywords for each post using all in one SEO?</li>
<li>I noticed that since moving to all in one SEO a lot of my posts are missing the meta description.</li>
<li>Can you make it to target the US audience?</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that is it at the moment having a quick look around.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m trying to get SEO jobs as quickly as possible at the moment. Particular in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lock-downs &#8211; digital marketing has never been more important.</p>
<p>Questions are, of course, always welcome.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
&#8216;Keywords&#8217; is a bit of a loaded term to be honest.<br />
I wrote a basic primer on the subject which became a very popular post:<br />
<a title="SEO Keywords in 2020" href="https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/">https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/</a></p>
<p>But the specific answer is I presume you&#8217;re talking about meta keyword tags? They haven&#8217;t been used in well over a decade &#8211; heck, we&#8217;re talking nearly two in some cases at this point! Back in 2009 Google blogged about how they didn&#8217;t (and never had) used those tags:<br />
<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html" rel="nofollow ">https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html</a></p>
<p>Bing actually never used keyword tags, and Yahoo stopped reading them at all about ten years ago.</p>
<p>In fact the plugin you used to use, Yoast, does have an option to turn on meta keyword tags, but it comes with a message: &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of any reason you&#8217;d want to do this.&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s actually evidence that suggests using them can harm your ranking, on Bing at least. Because it looks a lot like you&#8217;re relying on outdated techniques which of course isn&#8217;t ideal.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
Can you please double check that? I&#8217;ve just checked and it appears they&#8217;re all there&#8230;hopefully this was just a caching or some other issue with your host and what you were able to see in the SEO settings?</p>
<p>One thing I noticed is a lot of them (if not more!) were just copy and pastes of the first line or two from the blog post anyway. There&#8217;s no need to manually set that anymore &#8211; All In One SEO pack is set up to do that automatically. You won&#8217;t see it in the editor, but if if you look at the live code for a page all the meta tags will be in there, based on that schema.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong><br />
Done! I&#8217;ve set the country target to the USA.</p>
<p>As to the monthly SEO, you can see the details of that here:<br />
<a title="SEO Campaign for WordPress" href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/</a></p>

<p>I love how you presented yourself and feel pretty confident that you can help us with our project. We have to recruit our first 9 patients from the US who can give us testimonials for our service within 2-4 weeks of time. Our team thought of putting some ads on Facebook to find those participants.</p>
<p>How does your service work in order to make this happen? Could you please tell us about the process? Also, could you please tell us about the time duration and fees even?</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you very soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contacting me!</p>
<p>I appreciate the background information. In essence, my WordPress SEO work gives you higher ranking sin search results.</p>
<p>In terms of your specific needs though (9 US patients in 2-4 weeks) I&#8217;m not sure SEO would be the best route forward. It can take Google up to a week to scan the site after work is carried out to see the changes anyway, and then it tends to build over the coming fortnight.</p>
<p>SEO is absolutely the best digital marketing you can do &#8211; and the most cost effective &#8211; in the mid to long term. For a short term need, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend relying on it as your sole marketing attempt.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Best regards</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks! That first page of the SEO issues you&#8217;re raising looks to be a basic automatic SEO scan type thing &#8211; I don&#8217;t tend to love those &#8211; for good reason. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Most free reports are based on similar software packages (they&#8217;re just rebranded).</p>
<p>They&#8217;re notoriously out-of-date and behind on SEO best practice. One of the popular ones hasn&#8217;t been updated in nearly two years! And the other only recognises one of the three types of H1 tag (for example) that Google recommends.</p>
<p>In your case, every page has an H1. If you view the source code and search for:<br />
&lt;h1</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll see it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2570" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/h1-tag-on-title-440x54.png" alt="" width="440" height="54" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/h1-tag-on-title-440x54.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/h1-tag-on-title-240x30.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/h1-tag-on-title-768x95.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/h1-tag-on-title.png 835w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Similar situation with the alt tags &#8211; the image&#8217;s code is highlighted in blue. You&#8217;ll see both alt tags and titles tags in there!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2571" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alt-tag-title-tag-on-woocommerce-product-photos-440x234.png" alt="" width="440" height="234" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alt-tag-title-tag-on-woocommerce-product-photos-440x234.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alt-tag-title-tag-on-woocommerce-product-photos-240x128.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alt-tag-title-tag-on-woocommerce-product-photos-768x409.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alt-tag-title-tag-on-woocommerce-product-photos.png 876w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>The relevant issue in that doc is the &#8216;Content Wider Than Screen&#8217; issue for mobile usability. There&#8217;s actually two, not just one that&#8217;s showing as problematic. However, that mobile friendly test is notoriously buggy &#8211; Google often won&#8217;t load all your scripts when they run it. I&#8217;ve run manual tests on both those pages and they actually pass just fine.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2572" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mobile-usability-flriely-test-passes-google-440x323.png" alt="" width="440" height="323" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mobile-usability-flriely-test-passes-google-440x323.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mobile-usability-flriely-test-passes-google-240x176.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mobile-usability-flriely-test-passes-google-768x563.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mobile-usability-flriely-test-passes-google.png 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve marked both of those pages as &#8216;fixed&#8217; in Google Search Console, and they should clear soon.</p>
<p>Thanks as ever!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Thanks for your work.</p>
<p>With regard to the xml file, I would like to manage this via google console. I understand that you have submitted the sitemap, is there any issue with me uploading this directly? I made a few changes to the permalinks this morning as they were still related to the pages that were in the original theme that I didn&#8217;t notice before.</p>
<p>Were all of the H-Tags updated as part of the service and are they currently optimised?</p>
<p>Do you have any general feedback on our content? Is there anything we could do to improve the ranking of the site?</p>
<p>Finally, I plan to create area specific area pages for our site. Sometimes, people doing these have a lot of duplicate content. Would that lead to penalties due to the duplication of text?</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back to me!</p></blockquote>
<p>Questions are, of course, always welcome.</p>
<p>So&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
sitemap.xml</p>
<p>This gets submitted to Search Console but you can&#8217;t manage the contents of the file there if that&#8217;s what you mean. (Sorry if I&#8217;ve misunderstood!)</p>
<p>The current flow for this is that when you add a page, remove a change, edit permalinks etc the sitemap is updated automatically. It also sends a &#8216;ping&#8217; to Google and Bing letting them know it&#8217;s been changed. They then rescan the XML file and update their records accordingly.</p>
<p>So, unless you really need to do something bespoke with the sitemap.xml file you can leave it to do it&#8217;s thing. (In all my years I&#8217;ve only come across one instance where it needed to be coded manually 0 but perhaps you do have good reason!)</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
Ah! I didn&#8217;t include those in the write-up. Apologies! I did quite a bit of work on your heading tags in the background. The heading tags you had were already appropriate with good keywords to match content, so that was great.</p>
<p>But behind the scenes they were all H2 or H3s. No page had a single H1, which they should. So I worked to change the main heading tag on each page to H1, while also keeping the previous text size and styles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all as it should be now!</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong><br />
The main thing you could do yourselves would be some kind of blog or news type section. Regular, topical content makes SUCH a difference.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong><br />
Regarding the area pages technique, you do want to make sure the content is unique <em>enough</em>. If you&#8217;re just swapping out area names it&#8217;s not going to work. But as long as each page is substantially different it&#8217;s a great thing.</p>
<p>My usual recommendation for writing areas pages is this&#8230;</p>
<p>Do one day. And write it without looking back at what you wrote on the other ones. You&#8217;ll find you&#8217;ll naturally include the same information, but in different words.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hi Peter, I just caught up with your message.</p>
<p>Thank you for the report again and after I send this message I will be paying your next invoice.</p>
<p>It makes for an interesting read and i do have some questions and points:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;The number of times your site was seen in search results has increased by 26%<br />
Clicks to your site from search results are up 15%&#8221;<br />
Are there any statistics on:</p>
<ol>
<li>what people are looking at when they get to the site</li>
<li>If people are coming from facebook or instagram to look?</li>
<li>what are the actual numbers?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Search terms: we have found others seem popular so you may want to add them to your list.</li>
<li>The speed enhancement and error update tidy up sounds good. the 404 error and searching for yourself info was very interesting too</li>
<li>Just to clarify: we don&#8217;t sell from our office so location is irrelevant to us. We only sell online &#8211; and will deliver anywhere within the known universe</li>
<li>I will try to write some how-tos &#8211; does they have to go on the homepage?</li>
<li>Do you think the blog which I started on your advice is having any effect? I&#8217;m thinking it should fit in with the Bert update &#8211; if I am doing it right&#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Thanks for your input and help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Questions are, of course, always welcome.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
To give an idea of the actual figures (although I do usually track the growth, which is considered the optimal way to measure an SEO campaign)&#8230;<br />
In the past month actual clicks to the site from organic search results were: 1,149<br />
Impressions in the same period in organic search were: 36,941</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note I made a real point there of specifying &#8216;organic search&#8217; &#8211; that&#8217;s very much the domain SEO (and therefore my work) exists in. So I don&#8217;t have any stats for Facebook or Instagram. I can say the figures above really are just from search &#8211; so anything you get from social would be on top of those in your overall stats.</p>
<p>Similarly I don&#8217;t measure what happens to a visitors pathway after they get to your site either &#8211; that sort of thing is either considered the realm of generic Analytics (as opposed to search specific) or more explicitly &#8211; the realm of US (user experience) which is a whole different discipline.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
In terms of reporting I include up to 12 in the reports. Of course I&#8217;m targeting many, many more than that but for the sake of measuring growth and demonstrating the success 12 is more than sufficient.</p>
<p>But I can definitely swap some out for others if you&#8217;d like! Maybe you could just send me back a list of 12 you&#8217;d like and we&#8217;ll use those from now on.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong><br />
Oh I know &#8211; it&#8217;s just extra stuff Google likes to see in place even if it&#8217;s irrelevant to the operations of the business.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong><br />
It&#8217;s best on the homepage. Think of any content on the site like this &#8211; the more &#8216;steps&#8217; away it is from the homepage the slightly less import it has for your SEO authority.</p>
<p>So if the FAQs are on the homepage we can use the structured data approach to full effect. If they&#8217;re on a page that&#8217;s one click away from the homepage they&#8217;ve worth less. If they&#8217;re buried in a link from the footer or something&#8230; even worse.</p>
<p>The higher any content on the site (both in terms of how many clicks through the navigation it is to get to, AND how high it sits on a page) the more weight it has for SEO.</p>
<p>So, with the FAQs, I recommend they go on the homepage, but towards the bottom so they&#8217;re not in the way of other stuff.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong><br />
Yes! It is, and will continue to as you add more. It&#8217;s amazing how much of a difference blogging couple with an SEO campaign is.</p>
<p>Case in point is my own site:<br />
<a title="Wordpress SEO Expert Peter WM" href="http://peterwm.com">peterwm.com</a></p>
<p>I have great SEO on it of course, but being my own site it&#8217;s never really finished or up-to-date &#8211; my clients get all my time and my own &#8216;house&#8217; is never really finished. So I go through phases of blogging a lot and then I get busy and forget about it.</p>
<p>Well, just three weeks ago I started adding regular content again. One of my targets is &#8216;seo expert peter&#8217;. Google that &#8211; see where I suddenly am after just a spat of blogging and SEOing it all properly!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>How many pages do you SEO on each WordPress site? I&#8217;ve got about bout 25-30 pages. Iâ€™ve got someone working on the site speed as we speak right now.</p>
<p>So I guess hereâ€™s my real question. Do you look at each page individually re: seo meta tags and key words etc or just setup Yoast etc for the entire site.</p>
<p>Also do you do a more long term offer with monthly review etc.</p>
<p>Cheers</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes it&#8217;s complicated. (SEO isn&#8217;t straight forward!)</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Some pages will have bespoke tags written, others left to have them generated on-the-fly. For example, a News of Blog page that just has lists of the recent posts would need to be om-the-fly. Because the content is 100% dynamic &#8211; it changes as new content is added &#8211; there&#8217;s no static content to reinforce with search engines.</p>
<p>And in turn if we reinforce content through meta tags that have no relevancy to the page content itself, that can hurt the SEO setup.</p>
<p>So I do site-wide work of course, and then look at every page on an individual basis. But that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean every page will end up with bespoke tags.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense!</p>
<p>And yes, I do offer ongoing campaigns for people that really want to commit to organic search as a marketing strategy. You can read more about that here:<br />

<p>Do you also do PPC a setup. Eg if I wanted a campaign to run just for one product category?</p></blockquote>
<p>The best gig to buy would be the Â£120 one:<br />
<a title="Google WordPress SEO" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/</a></p>
<p>I set up GSC as aprt of my work as standard &#8211; but not GA to be honest. Because I focus on organic search, well the best data Google reports on for organic SEO is in Google Search Console. And setting up &#8216;My Business&#8217; is also a different kettle of fish &#8211; and usually includes having to verify your address which really does need to be done by you.</p>
<p>I could set up GA easily enough if you&#8217;d like &#8211; but not My Business.</p>
<p>I would just need you to send me an email address you use to access Google services (just the address, not the password) and I can happily do that as part of the work, adding you to the accounts.</p>
<p>As for PPC I&#8217;m afraid don&#8217;t offer it at all. Google Ads usually have a very low ROI, so low in fact that I stopped offering Adwords services myself years ago.</p>
<p>I used to offer it back when Adwords first launched, but the ROI on it is so low every single one of my clients wanted to drop it in favour of more SEO work; so I stopped offering it altogether.</p>
<p>I hope that all helps!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p id="txt-105168307">Also since changing to All in one SEO our homepage title is loading correctly. Could you advise?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can I ask how you&#8217;re testing your ranking please? And also, things are worse than that &#8211; all my settings have been removed from the site?! All the meta tags, titles, and general SEO settings too. Was that intentional?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d very much like to put them back in if I may. (I keep backups.)</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2488" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blank-seo-settings-all-in-one-seo-pack-440x407.png" alt="" width="440" height="407" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blank-seo-settings-all-in-one-seo-pack-440x407.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blank-seo-settings-all-in-one-seo-pack-240x222.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blank-seo-settings-all-in-one-seo-pack-768x710.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blank-seo-settings-all-in-one-seo-pack.png 1223w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>We use a system called Rankinty.</p>
<p>Strange, we haven&#8217;t changed anything. I did ask our web developers why and they said that maybe Yoast and all in one are conflicting. I did check and I&#8217;m pretty sure you deactivated Yoast (from what I can see).</p>
<p>No one our end would have changed anything.</p></blockquote>
<p>That wouldn&#8217;t cause the issue anyway. Both can be activated and have settings in the backend (although that&#8217;s awful for the actual SEO settings that get output &#8211; but it&#8217;s technically possible.)</p>
<p>It looks like a completely &#8216;fresh&#8217; install of All in One SEO Pack. If I had to wager a guess, I&#8217;d say it looks like someone accidentally deleted All In One, realised their error and reinstalled it (not realising that as of about 16 months ago, WordPress doesn&#8217;t keep settings for plugins if they&#8217;re deleted anymore).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the only thing I can think of that makes sense of it.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8211; I just want to double check &#8211; you&#8217;re happy for me to put all the work back in place?</p>
<p><em>Peter WM</em></p>
<blockquote><p>That is really odd. Could that be why the rankings took a bit of a dive?</p>
<p>Yes if you could please reinstate the work that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Another thing I wanted to ask you. How do companies have the below?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2489" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sitelinks-google-search-results-site-links-serps-440x292.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="292" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sitelinks-google-search-results-site-links-serps-440x292.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sitelinks-google-search-results-site-links-serps-240x159.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sitelinks-google-search-results-site-links-serps-768x509.jpg 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sitelinks-google-search-results-site-links-serps.jpg 771w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a couple of things with the issue of the rankings drop.</p>
<p>The first is I don&#8217;t love those third-party systems for reporting on organic search stats. I get all my stats directly from Google and Bing webmaster systems, which are the only official &#8216;from the horses mouth&#8217; places to get that data.</p>
<p>BUT, having said that &#8211; yes, it&#8217;s entirely possible the rankings dropped when the SEO work was removed.</p>
<p>I actually blogged about this recently, you can read the post here:<br />
<a title="Removing WordPress SEO settings is a bad idea" href="https://peterwm.com/case-study-turning-seo-work-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://peterwm.com/case-study-turning-seo-work-off/</a></p>
<p>but the short version if removing search engine optimisation rank has a nearly immediate, massively damaging effect on rankings and SEO stats!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll put the work back on for you right away.</p>
<p>As to your query about the &#8216;sub links&#8217; in search results, those are called &#8216;site links&#8217;, and Google chooses which pages to use itself.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s not 100% true &#8211; we&#8217;re able to say in our sitemap.xml file that certain pages have a greater &#8216;weighting&#8217; than others, which we have done. (For the top level navigation.)</p>
<p>But we can&#8217;t then do anything more than that to influence Google&#8217;s choice of site links. They only show them for something like 10% of sites that have all the right setup for them anyway &#8211; it&#8217;s all down to your overall website SEO and domain authority.</p>
<p>(They actually did use to have an option in their Search Console system to nominate pages they SHOULDN&#8217;T include as sitelinks. But that was removed some time ago.)</p>
<p>All we can do to influence them with site links is already done I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for the above, Peter. Much appreciated.</p></blockquote>
