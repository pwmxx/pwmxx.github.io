<p>I have an adult product site that has been running for a few months and we are using a Google AdWords campaign to get traffic to it, but even though you do get some sales, I would ideally like it to rank more organically. Could you possibly have a quick look and send me some recommendations and cost so that i can start a campaign to get it more popular?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me.</p>
<p>I would recommend having me overhaul your SEO ASAP actually. I don&#8217;t often say that, but the combination of your theme and the current SEO plugin means it&#8217;s outputting SEO not about your site, but them theme!</p>
<p>For example the homepage description is:<br />
&#8220;Shoptimizer is a fast and light-weight new WooCommerce theme from CommerceGurus. Built to best practices and focused on both speed and conversions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact if you look at the below image you&#8217;ll see Google is picking that up and showing it in search results!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2461" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/theme-description-showing-in-google-440x97.png" alt="" width="440" height="97" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/theme-description-showing-in-google-440x97.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/theme-description-showing-in-google-240x53.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/theme-description-showing-in-google.png 672w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to sort all this out and take care of it for you.</p>
<p>Proper, Google-friendly SEO will eventually have a much higher ROI than AdWords anyway.</p>
<p>Longer term SEO is absolutely the best, most cost-effective digital marketing (or to my mind <strong>any</strong> form of marketing) you can do.</p>
<p>But putting that to one side, right now your settings are going to be seriously hurting your SEO.</p>

<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>And congratulations for getting the new landing page up.</p>
<p>The best time to get me involved with your SEO is actually right after the site goes live. That way when I do the work I can do it all:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyword research</li>
<li>Devise the best strategy</li>
<li>Deploy all the SEO and related settings on the site</li>
<li>Do all the search engine submissions work (including sending the sitemap to them, pages, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do from time to time get involved earlier though if a client really wants. The way I manage that is I do everything except that final step, and we wrap the job up when I&#8217;ve done all I can at that stage.</p>
<p>But when they do put the site live they just let me know and I jump back in to do the Google, Bing and other search engines work &#8211; obviously without any further charge.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p>
<p>So the short version would be &#8211; after it&#8217;s live is best. But I can work on your site&#8217;s SEO earlier if you&#8217;d really like.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>I can do Wix SEO, absolutely. But there&#8217;s some important notes to consider if you&#8217;ve not already chosen the content management system you&#8217;ll be using.</p>
<p>Quite simply (and despite what they might say) Wix doesn&#8217;t offer anything like the range of SEO configurations that WordPress does.</p>
<p>Their SEO options are very limited.</p>
<p>As such, while I can technically SEO your site, a Wix site simply isn&#8217;t going to be able to compete in search results with a well SEO&#8217;d WordPress based competitor&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>It would still be better to have all the SEO you can get on it, but really I always recommend WordPress for anyone seriously looking to make the most of organic search ranking.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re well.</p>
<p>I am in need of some help with my website to have some work done to improve its SEO and also its Page Speed.</p>
<p>I have done a fair bit with the SEO but I do need more help. The Page Speed score is currently only 10 and I really would like this up there in the 90s without changing the structure of the site (which I am having difficulty with).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me! I can certainly help with your SEO (the homepage description I can see isn&#8217;t in line with best practice &#8211; and that&#8217;s the first thing I check!)</p>
<p>But speed might be another matter. My work is based around making the site load faster &#8211; NOT trying to improve Pagespeed % scores.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little background on that:<br />
<a href="https://peterwm.com/problems-with-google-pagespeed-insights/">https://peterwm.com/problems-with-google-pagespeed-insights/</a></p>
<p>But the short version is unless I was to totally recode your WordPress theme, and change a lot of it to reduce bloat &#8211; it&#8217;s probably impossible to go from 10% to 90%. That would be just huge.</p>
<p>WordPress is great in that it is so extensible, it&#8217;s easy to make it pretty much anything you want. But that comes with a lot of extra code. It&#8217;s not a great platform for % scores.</p>
<p>But it came be fast &#8211; my work usually reduces a sites loading time by 30-40%. (I can&#8217;t make promises on that though.)</p>
<p>Where my hands are tied is if the reason a site is slow is the server &#8211; if load balancing isn&#8217;t great, or a bunch of sites are thrown on the same web server &#8211; because I can&#8217;t affect that.</p>
<p>Anyway, some food for thought.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for checking &#8211; those are all pages we want marked as noindex!</p>
<p>They&#8217;re the &#8216;Stock&#8217; pages I referred to in my initial report when I delivered your SEO. In this case they are all just policy pages, terms &amp; conditions and cookie policy pages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll re-paste that section at the bottom of this message in case that&#8217;s helpful.</p>
<p>The reason they&#8217;re marked as &#8216;submitted but not indexed&#8217; is because they <strong>used</strong> to be submitted before I marked them otherwise. So really this is just Google letting you know about that change &#8211; eventually they&#8217;ll stop reporting these because they&#8217;ll see they are in fact <strong>not</strong> being submitted anymore.</p>
<p>I hope that&#8217;s helpful!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

A couple of pages on your site were &#8220;stock&#8221; pages, for example policy information. In order to make sure your site is compliant with the latest Google update, these were marked as &#8220;noindex&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason those sorts of pages are considered &#8220;stock&#8221; is they&#8217;re essentially standard pages (also known as &#8216;boilerplate&#8217;) that don&#8217;t reflect what your site is actually about.</p>
<p>A lot of sites use standard content for those, copied and pasted from elsewhere. So there can be duplicate content issues &#8211; but at the very least they don&#8217;t reflect the main purpose of your site, so they water down the message so-to-speak.</p>
<p>Google and Bing both recommend these sorts of pages be marked as &#8220;noindex&#8221;, meaning they won&#8217;t scan them and add them to the body of data about your site.</p>

<p>Page titles, Keywords, Description</p>
<p>What your turnaround at present?</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me, it&#8217;s great to hear from you again.</p>
<p>My turnaround is the usual up-to-three business days.</p>
<p>Your other questions actually have quite a bit to unpack though. So I&#8217;ll go through them all in turn.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
Up to 40 pages per site is usually considered fair. But that just refers to the number of pages you might want to have tags crafted for manually. You don&#8217;t always want that for all types of content.</p>
<p>So, the main pages on a site should always have manually strategised and written tags. But the same isn&#8217;t always true for other types of content. Sometimes for posts, and nearly always for products, you want those to be created on-the-fly (when a visitor loads the page) based on a series of rules, or schemas, that Google recommends.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for that, but the two main ones are:</p>
<p><em>AUTOPILOT</em><br />
When those more dynamic content types can be set up to create tags for you, it saves you having to worry about that going forward. You&#8217;re free to focus on creating new content, posts, products, etc.</p>
<p><em>RELEVANCY</em><br />
This is the biggie. Google cares a lot about the &#8216;relevancy&#8217; of your SEO settings and tags. Does the content in the tags match the content on the page? This sort of setup gives a 100% relevancy for description tags which is awesome.</p>
<p>And of course search engines don&#8217;t just judge each page by itself, they look at the site as a whole and ascribe SEO authority to the domain too.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s imagine a site has 10 static &#8216;Pages&#8217; in WordPress, but 100 &#8216;Posts&#8217;. If all those posts have a full, 100% relevancy score then we have a bit more leeway with the main Pages. So we can make them more keyword rich without risking triggering a &#8216;lack of relevance&#8217; problem.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
On to keywords. Those keyword meta tags haven&#8217;t been used in a very long time, well over a decade. Google confirmed in 2009 they didn&#8217;t (and hadn&#8217;t) used them:<br />
<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html</a></p>
<p>Bing never used that tag, and Yahoo stopped around ten years ago.</p>
<p>In fact while the Yoast SEO plugin does have an option to use keyword meta tags, but it actually has a comment next to the option:<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of any reason you&#8217;d want to use this.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even strong evidence (from Bing) that using them incorrectly will get you penalised!</p>
<p>It can be confusing because in the industry people do still talk about keywords, but they mean it in a different context. You can read about that here:<br />
<a href="https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/">https://peterwm.com/a-few-key-words-about-keywords/</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s rather a lot of information about on-page SEO &#8211; but I hope it&#8217;s helpful!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Someone is working on the messaging and content for the client and I will be working on the front end design and branding. We will probably be going for a WordPress based theme.</p>
<p>I had a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any ongoing monthly fees?</li>
<li>Do you integrate Google Search Console?</li>
<li>Do you use Yoast or Rankmath?</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you need more detail about the client/website before getting started?</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>I have a few <em>answers</em> for you&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><br />
I do offer an ongoing SEO campaign option &#8211; many people are perfectly happy with the one-time overhaul and the fee for that &#8211; but clients that really want to commit to SEO (which is hands down the best, cheapest marketing you can do) will usually carry on.</p>
<p>I actually throw in a free month of that service too, so people can see the value first-hand.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><br />
Yes, absolutely. Google Search Console is the authoritative place for Google&#8217;s organic search statistics. It&#8217;s a vital tool for anyone working in SEO.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong><br />
Actually, I choose the plugin based on several factors with the site itself. Different plugins are best for different websites&#8211;the way you&#8217;re using pages, posts etc is important in deciding. I don&#8217;t have a favourite, I like to look at a site and decide which plugin would be best for it on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Something I can say though is in about 80% of cases All In One SEO pack ends up being selected.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally)</strong><br />
The best time to engage me is immediately after the site has gone live. That way I can do all the various submission processes alongside the search engine optimisation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big believer that all information is good information &#8211; so if you wanted to send through more info on the client that would be welcome. But it&#8217;s also true the current content I can see I believe gives me more than enough information about her to base the work on.</p>

<p>I think 2 &amp; 3 are covered in your offer here. Can you also help with 1?<br />
I think I already have most of the set up bit in place (site map, SEO pack etc).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>I have a few thoughts around this&#8230;</p>
<p>1)<br />
I don&#8217;t do speed work by itself anymore &#8211; only bundled with SEO. I can probably make the site faster &#8211; I usually achieve around an 35-40% increase in loading time (I can&#8217;t make promises of course!) but because your iste currently loads in around 6 seconds that&#8217;s still not going to be terribly fast.</p>
<p>You can see from the attached benchmark in the &#8216;File Requests&#8217; graph towards the bottom that the thing taking most of the loading time is actually just the very first &#8216;connection&#8217; bit. That suggests it could be a problem with the server causing the slowdown, not the site, which I wouldn&#8217;t be able to resolve for you.</p>
<p>2)<br />
Your SEO could do with an overhaul to be honest. Just looking at something as basic as the homepage description it&#8217;s already breaking one of the main rules &#8211; it has too many commas. Too many of those and Google assume you&#8217;re just keyword stuffing. Which to be fair is what you&#8217;re doing here.</p>
<p>So I can certainly overhaul your SEO, and look to improve the loading time as part of the job with the add-on.</p>
<p>Up to you obviously! Thanks again,</p>

<p>Thanks for contacting me. It&#8217;s always good to be recommended!</p>
<p>My offer would be appropriate for your site: you don&#8217;t have a lot of SEO work on there currently so it would certainly make a difference.</p>
<p>A few general thoughts:</p>
<p>1)<br />
Your homepage is a bit light on text. Personally I&#8217;d recommend you rewrite the main About page text (to ensure it&#8217;s unique) and include that on the homepage too. If that isn&#8217;t feasible I&#8217;d suggest moving the main About page text to the homepage instead.</p>
<p>2)<br />
It&#8217;s good you have active social media accounts. They can work well for social related traffic to your site (when you link from them to pages on the site) but actually have very little SEO impact. Facebook for example has marked all their outbound links as &#8216;nofollow&#8217; for some years. So links don&#8217;t count towards your SEO authority. In my experience social accounts are best used to create a mini &#8216;community&#8217; on those platforms you can have your own specific strategies for.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I had a client recently who (for reasons exclusively to do with the inexperience of their website&#8217;s designer) turned off one of the SEO plugins I had installed and configured for them.</h2>
<p><strong>It happened shortly after I carried out an <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/" title="Wordpress SEO overhaul work">initial SEO overhaul</a> on their site, so gives us a valuable insight into the effect of getting SEO done, and the removing it again.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2364" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png" alt="" width="440" height="132" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-240x72.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-768x230.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very small (and brand new company), but you can see the effects in this graph &#8211; taken directly from Google Search Console.</p>
<p>Initially after my work their SEO stats began to shoot up, gaining traction and upward momentum. Immediately after deactivating just one plugin it plummeted back to its original position.</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t use to happen so quickly. If you took SEO work off a site, or just fell behind with updates and changes to best practice, things would trail off over time. It now appears not having the very best SEO at all times leads to an immediate decrease in SEO authority. Because so many website owners (your competitors!) invest in SEO these days it means any time you don&#8217;t have it working, they can rise above you in the rankings.</p>
<p>But other SEO professionals have tried the same thing (turning off a single SEO plugin on their own testing sites) and see the same result. <em>The drop is nearly immediate.</em></p>
