										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I hope you&#8217;re well. I need some help with my site.<br />
1. Increase speed, reports tell me it&#8217;s slow<br />
2. SEO audit &amp; recommendations<br />
3. SEO optimisation</p>
<p>I think 2 &amp; 3 are covered in your offer here. Can you also help with 1?<br />
I think I already have most of the set up bit in place (site map, SEO pack etc).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for contacting me!</p>
<p>I have a few thoughts around this&#8230;</p>
<p>1)<br />
I don&#8217;t do speed work by itself anymore &#8211; only bundled with SEO. I can probably make the site faster &#8211; I usually achieve around an 35-40% increase in loading time (I can&#8217;t make promises of course!) but because your iste currently loads in around 6 seconds that&#8217;s still not going to be terribly fast.</p>
<p>You can see from the attached benchmark in the &#8216;File Requests&#8217; graph towards the bottom that the thing taking most of the loading time is actually just the very first &#8216;connection&#8217; bit. That suggests it could be a problem with the server causing the slowdown, not the site, which I wouldn&#8217;t be able to resolve for you.</p>
<p>2)<br />
Your SEO could do with an overhaul to be honest. Just looking at something as basic as the homepage description it&#8217;s already breaking one of the main rules &#8211; it has too many commas. Too many of those and Google assume you&#8217;re just keyword stuffing. Which to be fair is what you&#8217;re doing here.</p>
<p>So I can certainly overhaul your SEO, and look to improve the loading time as part of the job with the add-on.</p>
<p>Up to you obviously! Thanks again,</p>

I just wanted to know a little bit more about how you would be able to help us rank higher on Google.

<p>Thanks for contacting me. It&#8217;s always good to be recommended!</p>
<p>My offer would be appropriate for your site: you don&#8217;t have a lot of SEO work on there currently so it would certainly make a difference.</p>
<p>A few general thoughts:</p>
<p>1)<br />
Your homepage is a bit light on text. Personally I&#8217;d recommend you rewrite the main About page text (to ensure it&#8217;s unique) and include that on the homepage too. If that isn&#8217;t feasible I&#8217;d suggest moving the main About page text to the homepage instead.</p>
<p>2)<br />
It&#8217;s good you have active social media accounts. They can work well for social related traffic to your site (when you link from them to pages on the site) but actually have very little SEO impact. Facebook for example has marked all their outbound links as &#8216;nofollow&#8217; for some years. So links don&#8217;t count towards your SEO authority. In my experience social accounts are best used to create a mini &#8216;community&#8217; on those platforms you can have your own specific strategies for.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I had a client recently who (for reasons exclusively to do with the inexperience of their website&#8217;s designer) turned off one of the SEO plugins I had installed and configured for them.</h2>
<p><strong>It happened shortly after I carried out an <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/" title="Wordpress SEO overhaul work">initial SEO overhaul</a> on their site, so gives us a valuable insight into the effect of getting SEO done, and the removing it again.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2364" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png" alt="" width="440" height="132" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-440x132.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-240x72.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph-768x230.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/april-2020-graph.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very small (and brand new company), but you can see the effects in this graph &#8211; taken directly from Google Search Console.</p>
<p>Initially after my work their SEO stats began to shoot up, gaining traction and upward momentum. Immediately after deactivating just one plugin it plummeted back to its original position.</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t use to happen so quickly. If you took SEO work off a site, or just fell behind with updates and changes to best practice, things would trail off over time. It now appears not having the very best SEO at all times leads to an immediate decrease in SEO authority. Because so many website owners (your competitors!) invest in SEO these days it means any time you don&#8217;t have it working, they can rise above you in the rankings.</p>
<p>But other SEO professionals have tried the same thing (turning off a single SEO plugin on their own testing sites) and see the same result. <em>The drop is nearly immediate.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Please remember when saving images to upload to the web &#8211; photos should be saved as JPGs.</h2>
<p><strong>PNG is another popular format for the web but it works best on images like logos, with large blocks of the same colour.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2359" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-440x231.png" alt="" width="440" height="231" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-440x231.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-240x126.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-600x315.png 600w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos-768x403.png 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jpg-png-photos.png 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Anything like a photograph that is made up of 1000s of different colours will always be best as a JPG &#8211; and usually about one 10th the filesize.</p>
<p>Of the clients that ask me to speed up their WordPress websites (in addition to their <a title="Wordpress SEO" href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">SEO work</a>) perhaps the most improvement comes from simply converting their photos they&#8217;ve saved as PNGs into JPGs. If a site has several photos that are saved as the wrong file type it&#8217;s easy to shave several megabytes off the page size, and therefore speed up the site&#8217;s loading time.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is a lot of software for editing images will default to PNG when you use their &#8220;Save for web&#8221; function. Which is fine for icons and logos, charts and even text saved as an image.</p>
<p>So many websites these days focus on really high quality imagery (understandably &#8211; people <em>love</em> photographs!) but don&#8217;t know that not all file types are created equally, they all have different purposes and use cases and those wonderful product shots should <strong>always</strong> be saved as JPGs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to get in the habit of doing this right away &#8211; after an image is uploaded into WordPress there&#8217;s no simply way to convert it to JPG and change all the references in the code to use the different filename. So try to get it right from the outset!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>There&#8217;s been a number of news stories about the BERT update from Google.</h2>
<p><strong>These were followed by a slew of other stories about how the previous ones were misleading.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explain.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2322" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-bert-algorithm-update.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>If we go back several years to what was a very big announcement from Google &#8211; they turned on something they called RankBrain. At the time it was a new system and approach to search engine optimisation. They were using artificial intelligence to try to read webpages more like a human (actual visitors) would.</p>
<p>It was such a big deal because context suddenly became very important. The days of simply matching how many times you used certain keywords in your content against searches were over &#8211; it was crucial to write informative, useful content.</p>
<p>(That seems like a non-brainer anyway &#8211; content should always be useful and informative.)</p>
<p>But it was the beginning of the end for the concept of &#8216;how many keywords you can rank for&#8217;, or &#8216;just say this three times and you&#8217;ll rank really highly&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the years following Google has made all kinds of similar small updates to improve that system. They&#8217;re committed to returning useful well-written, informative results; and they&#8217;ve regularly made changes to their algorithm to further that aim.</p>
<h3>The BERT SEO update</h3>
<p>The BERT update really just pushes that to the next level. &#8216;Pattern matching&#8217; for specific phrases isn&#8217;t enough anymore, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is all in line with what I&#8217;ve been saying for years &#8211; don&#8217;t just write to specific words (whether they&#8217;re &#8216;long tail&#8217; or something else, the concept of expecting a certain amount of repetition to rock your SEO isn&#8217;t valid) &#8211; rather write well thought out content that explains what you&#8217;re trying to say.</p>
<p>(This is why some of the recent news stories about BERT backtracked about how important it was &#8211; because while it <strong>is</strong> important &#8211; it&#8217;s just a continuation of the same direction Google&#8217;s been going for a long time.)</p>
<p>To give you an example. You&#8217;d think the key with my own site is to mention <em>SEO</em> a lot. That&#8217;s easy to do &#8211; but harder to do in a way that makes it clear to the reader that I&#8217;m an authority on the subject, and even harder to impart useful information that might entice people back to my blog.</p>
<p>Simply repeating keywords is essentially keyword stuffing and Google knows it.</p>
<p>My recommendation for writing content hasn&#8217;t changed. Write to your audience, not to search engines. If you&#8217;re writing an about page then write about what you do and how you help people. Useful, natural words and phrases will come out of that anyway.</p>
<p>Your visitors &#8211; and increasingly your search engine ranking &#8211; will thank you for it.</p>
<h3>Why context matters so much for SEO</h3>
<p>As search engines continue to prepare for voice search being used more often (voice searches are usually quite conversational in their wording) context becomes more important.</p>
<p>To give a really basically example, let&#8217;s think about a site that may have been a review for a florist. Even if the content said something negative, for example &#8220;What a rubbish florist&#8221;, previously it would have helped rank for the search query &#8216;florist&#8217;. Increasingly Google can understand the negativity there and is less likely to present that site to someone who clearly wants to find a reputable local florist.</p>
<p>That really is a very basic example, but context is <em>so</em> important.</p>
<h3>What needs changing for your WordPress SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">As a WordPress SEO expert</a> every change and update to SEO algorithms always comes back to the same question, &#8220;How does this impact WordPress SEO?&#8221; The answer in this case is <em>very little.</em> <a href="https://peterwm.com/homepage-faq-structured-data-to-improve-your-seo-rank/">Unlike structured data</a> or other updates that necessitate coding changes to your site, this really is all about content.</p>
<p>Fortunately WordPress itself is all about content and the ease of editing or creating it &#8211; so that&#8217;s a real boon. It&#8217;s easy to edit your site&#8217;s content to make it as contextual, human readable and useful as possible.</p>
<p>But there is no immediate need to jump in add or remove any plugins or systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>This is a creative use of Google Search Console I&#8217;ve come up with for some easy SEO wins</h2>
<p><strong>And it&#8217;s been working really well on all my testing sites.</strong></p>
<p>Google Search Console (GSC) is Google&#8217;s official stats system for organic search, and has the most useful data about your site&#8217;s ranking, visits, clicks, etc.</p>
<p>They changed the interface for it some time ago and keep adding more data in it. One new page will show you all the pages in your site they&#8217;ve crawled, but chosen <strong>not</strong> to include in search results.</p>
<p>So they know about these pages, but don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth including in their results pages. The effect of that is these pages are <em>not</em> actually helping with your SEO at all. From an SEO viewpoint they may as well not be there.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons I&#8217;ve found why otherwise useful content is being ignored by Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s just too short</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not on-topic enough</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your content might just be too short</h3>
<p>This is fairly self-explanatory. Unless you&#8217;ve got 300+ words of text on a page it will often be ignored.</p>
<h3>Your content might not be on-topic <em>enough</em></h3>
<p>The best way to explain this is with an example, let&#8217;s think about a digital marketing firm. Perhaps when they started they offered a variety of services from social media content to web development and SEO.</p>
<p>Well now they just focus on the latter. Their homepage is about it, all their services pages are too &#8211; but they have old blog posts about their older services.</p>
<p>Google knows what a site&#8217;s core service offering is. And things that might fall outside that &#8211; either because they&#8217;re just off topic or simply old and reflect what a business *used* to be about &#8211; they&#8217;re likely to get ignored as well.</p>
<h3>Re-purpose old content to get it indexed and working for your SEO!</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s my recommendation. Have a look through the list of crawled but not indexed pages and see if there are any you can fix.</p>
<p>Doing this myself I found any short pages I fleshed out, or outdated ones I re-tooled to reflect what I&#8217;m doing now &#8211; every single one got picked up again by Google.</p>
<p>In some cases it was just a matter of adding an extra paragraph to an existing post. That&#8217;s not nearly as cumbersome as writing an entirely new one but essentially gets a whole extra page indexed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Using FAQs on your site to get extra traffic from search results</h2>
<p><strong>Google loves a good Q&amp;A, and they&#8217;re great for your search engine optimisation.</strong></p>
<p>This is an excellent technique that Google has been responding to very positively recently. It involves a fairly interesting type of structured data.</p>
<p>Structured data is a series of tags and what&#8217;s known as <em>microdata</em> that Google, Bing and Yahoo all use to work out what content on your site matches specific, common types of information like phone numbers. It primarily sits in your pages&#8217; code &#8211; it&#8217;s not something the user sees directly. Although in the case of FAQs you do want them to be able to see them as well &#8211; that way your front-end information matches what&#8217;s happening behind the scenes. Google definitely wants to see that the information you&#8217;re supplying <em>them</em> is also what you&#8217;re giving to your <em>users.</em></p>
<p>You may have noticed little &#8216;People also ask&#8217; <em>click-to-open</em> sections like this on Google results pages before:</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-2297 alignnone" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png" alt="" width="440" height="316" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-440x316.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation-240x173.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seo-faq-structured-data-google-search-engine-optimisation.png 658w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Those questions and answers are being pulled from web pages with &#8216;FAQ&#8217; structured data on their homepages.</p>
<p>This technique involves adding an FAQ section to your own homepage, and then having the appropriate code added to those so Google can pick them up correctly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried this with a handful of clients and most have seen a 3-4 ranking place increase as a result! Even if Google doesn&#8217;t end up using your FAQs on their results page, the effect is the same; they just like to see the code in place.</p>
<p>So this is well worth implementing as part of your SEO strategy.</p>
<p>When writing FAQs for this purpose though it&#8217;s best to make them somewhat generic &#8211; they should be about your industry generally rather than about your specific offering. (If you take a look at the ones I wrote <a href="https://peterwm.com/">on my own homepage,</a> you&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re <em>predominantly</em> about SEO and it&#8217;s advantages rather than being about the services I offer myself.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like me to implement this for you <a href="mailto:peter@webcraft.co">please just get in touch</a> &#8211; and of course I can do it all for you as part of <a href="https://peterwm.com/ongoing-wordpress-seo-campaign/">an ongoing SEO campaign too.</a></p>

<p><strong>And the attitude of the cowboys that do it is just shocking.</strong></p>
<p>I recently had an exchange with a potential SEO client. At least they <em>thought</em> they were a potential client.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2226" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-440x248.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="248" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-440x248.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-240x135.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers-768x432.jpg 768w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-cowboys-google-link-spammers.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Before I begin I should point out about 70% of my work is for digital marketing agencies who on-sell my work to their clients. I&#8217;m more than happy to do that &#8211; but it&#8217;s incredible how many people try to take the piss.</p>
<p>Perhaps every other week I have an order come through for a marketing agency that sells SEO work &#8211; who want me to SEO their own site but <strong>not</strong> their clients&#8217;! They don&#8217;t have enough knowledge, experience or confidence to SEO their own site &#8211; but they&#8217;ll happily charge people to do shoddy work for them.</p>
<p>This recent exchange I had wasn&#8217;t even that honest about the intent though &#8211; it was from someone who said they were just an ordinary client, but betrayed themselves with a few key phrases I&#8217;ve become very au fait with:<br />
<em>I don&#8217;t have time for this one</em> = &#8220;I charge people for SEO myself but for one reason or another can&#8217;t do this one. Probably because I don&#8217;t know how to deliver quality search engine optimisation.&#8221;<br />
<em>If I order now, can you do it this afternoon</em> (asked at 3pm) = &#8220;Not only do I have no idea how long decent WordPress SEO takes, but I&#8217;m kinda of pushy and rude too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the exchange I had the question that guarantees I&#8217;m talking to a cowboy:<br />
<em>I need 500+ backlinks too.</em></p>
<p>Also, presumably, by 5pm that day. 🙂</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret I strongly dislike the industry that&#8217;s cropped up around the automatic creation of backlinks. <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/backlinks/">I blog about it a lot</a> &#8211; but the short version is Google says it&#8217;s against their rules and they actively try to find and penalise sites that do it.</p>
<p>I replied with <a href="https://peterwm.com/backlinks-are-great-for-seo-but-only-if-theyre-legitimate/">a link to one of my posts on the subject,</a> thinking there was still a chance I was talking with someone genuinely interested in proper white-hat SEO. Then I got this reply.</p>
<blockquote><p>All SEOs use techniques that google ideally would not want you to use because they work, right? At the end of the day, google&#8217;s ranking process is just an algorithm. The recent planned Google updates for Links coming in march 2020 may help clean up link building but SEOs will still find holes in the algorithm.</p>
<p>The clients you work with surly (sic) care more about results than a multi-billionaire business algorithm and how well you follow these guidelines?</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s just a small part of it. There were 20+ other questions demanding I prove all manner of things about SEO and the correct approach to it. In and of itself that&#8217;s not a problem (I like to respond to questions to help people wherever I can) but it was all just so aggressively <em>defensive.</em></p>
<p>I replied as honestly and directly as I could.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to be a good fit together.</p>
<p>The whole idea that<br />
<em>All SEOs use techniques that google ideally would not want you to use because they work, right?</em></p>
<p>isn&#8217;t in line with my or Google&#8217;s ethos. Or what&#8217;s considered best practice in the industry.</p>
<p>Grey and blackhat techniques might work for a while, but never in the long term. And my clients are interested in long term success, not quick wins that end up hurting them when Google adjusts their systems accordingly. When you do SEO properly you&#8217;ll find Google algorithm updates actually IMPROVE ranking.</p>
<p>To be really honest you seem to be defending what could best be described as a <strong>cowboy approach.</strong> And that sort of SEO tends to lead to algorithm changes harming ranking rather than helping.</p>
<p>So while I do genuinely wish you all the best for the future, I hope you&#8217;ll understand that I&#8217;m not interested in working with you. We clearly have very different ideas of what good SEO is.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly not the most diplomatic response I&#8217;ve ever sent. But if someone is going to suggest my clients want short-lived gains that come at the cost of massive penalties later I feel like <em>they&#8217;re</em> being insulted. Good SEO (like good business) looks for long-term solutions.</p>
<p>The bit where I did try to be diplomatic was that last line.</p>
<blockquote><p>We clearly have very different ideas of what good SEO is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because search engine optimisation is not about a personal belief or idea about what you want it to be. It <strong>is</strong> based on an algorithm &#8211; a predictable one. There&#8217;s evidence to show what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Why would you ever do anything except the very best approach?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>SEO is SEO, but when you&#8217;re advertising the different forms of English can get in the way.</h2>
<p><strong>I work with people all around the world, but there&#8217;s quite a bit more to achieving that than you might think.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to sell services around the world from the comfort of your own office is fantastic. But for those of us with geographically ambiguous spellings it raises a few issues.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2109" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="211" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-440x211.jpg 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization-240x115.jpg 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/seo-british-english-american-english-optimisation-optization.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I speak (and write) <em>British English</em> &#8211; or as we like to call it, just <em>English. </em>So naturally I list my services using that spelling; in this case <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">Search Engine Optimisation.</a> But a large proportion of people around the world will be spelling that last word with a Z rather than an S.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s John Mueller has tried to say it doesn&#8217;t make a difference but I rather think he&#8217;s over-simplifying the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My understanding is it doesn&#39;t play any role for SEO &#8212; maybe for users (and conversions), but not directly for SEO.</p>
<p>&mdash; 🍌 John 🍌 (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1100684747565686784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We can see in Google Search Console variants based on language are reported as different stats. I simply don&#8217;t believe Google&#8217;s system is allowing different spellings of words interchangeably. Searching for &#8220;Search Engine Optimisation&#8221; is much more likely to find my site than the American spelling precisely because I use it more often in my text.</p>
<p>There are ways I try to work around this. When I sell my services on specific service marketplaces (like <a href="https://pph.me/peter">PeoplePerHour)</a> they have the option to include &#8216;tags&#8217; behind the scenes &#8211; users don&#8217;t see those but they help support the sites&#8217; fairly rudimentary search functions. So that&#8217;s a nice way of making sure I&#8217;m found for both spellings there.</p>
<p>But the second part of John Mueller&#8217;s reply is the most interesting. Let&#8217;s imagine Google did have some magic way of knowing everything all language variations were referring to and would show results regardless of those differences. The meta information displayed isn&#8217;t going to change. I could be found for Optimization but the information in front of the user will <strong>still</strong> say Optimisation.</p>
<p>That slight language difference could put a potential client off.</p>
<p>The better approach would be to allow different meta settings for different languages. But even that is fraught with technical and other issues &#8211; really there is just no simple fix for this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue to sell my SEO services around the world, but predominantly to the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Purely for technical reasons &#8211; because when it comes to <a href="https://peterwm.com/complete-wordpress-seo-overhaul/">delivering awesome SEO</a> I can do that for anyone, anywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>All off-site SEO basically comes down to is creating <em>backlinks.</em></h2>
<p><strong>Directory listings, local citations, they&#8217;re all much the same when it comes to it.</strong></p>
<p>Backlinks help if they&#8217;re legitimate &#8211; which means someone likes your site and has a proper reason to link to it. Any attempt to manipulate your own link profile goes <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against Google&#8217;s guidelines</a> &#8211; and they&#8217;re adept at catching people and penalising them for it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2098" src="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png" alt="" width="440" height="145" srcset="https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-440x145.png 440w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo-240x79.png 240w, https://peterwm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buying-backlinks-seo.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about this a number of times &#8211; <a href="https://peterwm.com/category/backlinks/">you can read some of those</a> if you&#8217;d like more information.</p>
<p>My approach to SEO is entirely Google friendly; I very much believe the best approach is to match the search engines&#8217; approach and fulfill their guidelines and recommendations.</p>
<p>This is sort of a catch-22, because while you shouldn&#8217;t fake links you do want them. My usual advice is to make use of your real life contacts to get some &#8211; ask suppliers or related sites to link to you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I should add too when people DO get links without properly asking people they really know for them &#8211; they tend to get extremely low quality ones. Too many low quality links hurts rather than helps. For example, every single person I&#8217;ve ever seen selling a <em>BBC, Apple</em> or <em>Huffington Post</em> link are actually just creating user profiles on those systems and sticking URLs in the bio section of those profiles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really a proper link on the BBC! People think they&#8217;re going to get something in a news article, but more often than not they&#8217;re on pages Google doesn&#8217;t even index. The effect is people buy a back link on a &#8216;high quality domain&#8217; but don&#8217;t get any SEO authority for it at all.</p>
<p>The people selling these links aren&#8217;t even doing it manually. There are automated tools they use to create hundreds of links in a few minutes. <strong>Google is smarter than this.</strong></p>
<p>Because Google says explicitly that trying to manipulate your own link profile is against their terms there is no such thing as paying for <em>Google safe</em> links. It&#8217;s an oxymoron.</p>
