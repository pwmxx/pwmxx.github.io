					<description><![CDATA[Ah yes, I completely understand this problem, I currently  have 3 websites, and I am trying to figure out the best way of developing my personal brand, understanding how to grow my services, without treading on what I currently do elsewhere. Etc. Etc. 

Even as a Chartered Institute Marketing qualified person I still have trouble understanding the best ways to do that! 

Good luck.
